/*
 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files
 * listed below.
 *
 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, vendor/assets/stylesheets,
 * or any plugin's vendor/assets/stylesheets directory can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the bottom of the
 * compiled file so the styles you add here take precedence over styles defined in any styles
 * defined in the other CSS/SCSS files in this directory. It is generally better to create a new
 * file per style scope.
 *
 *= require_self
 *= require style
 *= require rails_bootstrap_forms
 *
 * NOTE: removed 'require_tree .', as this conflicts with sass/scss @import behaviour
 *   see: https://github.com/rails/sass-rails
 * So do not forget to add an @import for any extra scss files you want to include,
 * as they will not be picked up automatically anymore !!!
