Assessment Methods</p><p>1. Method-1: Meeting GSAS Limits</p><p>30-minute average measured PM10 and PM2.5 values will be input in [OE.1] Dust Control Calculator. For both PM10 and PM2.5, the calculator will compute the maximum average value per Construction Stage, which should be equal or below the correspondent GSAS limit in order to achieve the related level. If the maximum average value is above GSAS limits the Project may use Method-2.</p><p>PM10 ≤ 150 μg/m3</p><p>PM2.5 ≤ 35 μg/m3</p><p>2. Method-2: Meeting the Background Limits</p><p>The Project may take advantage of simultaneous readings combined with wind direction and speed to estimate background dust levels. Readings upwind of the construction activity may be considered as background dust provided that:</p><ul><li>The monitoring point is located at least 15 meters away from the construction activity.</li><li>The average wind speed is equal to or greater than 1.3 m/s.</li></ul><p>The Project shall submit a report comparing the measured levels to the existing background dust levels. This report shall include:</p><ul><li>The methodology used to estimate the background levels.</li><li>Comparison proving actual dust levels do not exceed the background levels.</li></ul><p>The report will be analyzed by GSAS Trust.</p><p>III. Continuous Monitoring</p><p>An incentive of 2% will be awarded for additional efforts on continuous monitoring of the required parameters.</p><p>Project will achieve the 2% incentive weight provided that continuous monitoring for both PM10 and PM2.5 is performed in at least one location, 24 hours a day during the whole Construction Stage.</p><p>It is highly recommended that Project perform continuous monitoring using at least two pieces of equipment, upwind and downwind of the construction site, orientated in the direction of the prevailing wind. Therefore, the Project may take advantage of continuous and simultaneous measures to estimate the background levels.</p><p><span>Note:</span> if the purchased equipment can read either PM10 or PM2.5, the measurements will be accepted for incentive score if complied with an agreed-on interval.

Readings upwind of the construction activity may be considered as background dust provided that:</p><ul><li>The monitoring point is located at least 15 meters away from the construction activity.</li><li>The average wind speed is equal to or greater than 1.3 m/s.</li></ul><p>The Project shall submit a report comparing the measured levels to the existing background dust levels. This report shall include:</p><ul><li>The methodology used to estimate the background levels.</li><li>Comparison proving actual dust levels do not exceed the background levels.</li></ul><p>The report will be analyzed by GSAS Trust.</p><p>III. Continuous Monitoring</p><p>An incentive of 2% will be awarded for additional efforts on continuous monitoring of the required parameters.</p><p>Project will achieve the 2% incentive weight provided that continuous monitoring for both PM10 and PM2.5 is performed in at least one location, 24 hours a day during the whole Construction Stage.</p><p>It is highly recommended that Project perform continuous monitoring using at least two pieces of equipment, upwind and downwind of the construction site, orientated in the direction of the prevailing wind. Therefore, the Project may take advantage of continuous and simultaneous measures to estimate the background levels.</p><p><span>Note:</span> if the purchased equipment can read either PM10 or PM2.5, the measurements will be accepted for incentive score if complied with an agreed-on interval.

The monitoring equipment will be set to measure the L<span>Aeq, T</span> every 20 minutes.</li><li>At each construction stage, the Project will measure the sound levels arising from the construction activities (sound levels generated during construction) by measuring the sound levels at the same four approved monitoring points. The monitoring will also be conducted for a 24-hour period at each one of the four points, on consecutive working days, during the construction stage peak activity. The monitoring equipment will be set to measure the L<span>Aeq, T</span> every 20 minutes.</li><li>Both the background sound levels, and the sound levels generated during construction will be input in [OE.2] Noise &amp; Vibration Control Calculator, following the instructions outlined under the Calculator section. The calculator will compare the sound levels generated during construction to the limits set by the local authorities. If all the L<span>Aeq, 20min</span> generated during construction are below the limits, the noise monitoring is considered compliant. Otherwise, the calculator will recalculate the limits based on a combination of the limits from the local authorities and the background sound levels.

Noise from Plant and Equipment</p><p>The noise generated by plant and equipment especially affects the workers on-site; therefore, projects must ensure that low noise plant and equipment is utilized on-site to protect the health and safety of the workers.</p><p>The BS 5228-1:2009+A1:2014 or equivalent standard can be used as a reference for measuring the sound level generated by plant and mechanical equipment. It provides guidance concerning methods of predicting and measuring noise and assessing the impact on those exposed to it.</p><p>The scope of the monitoring is limited to noise-generating stationary and mobile equipment and plant operating on the construction site.

The post-development areas are the areas of the land with or without improved classifications after applying the land remediation measures or planned enhancement strategies. Areas of the land found to be contaminated would require complete remediation before commencing the works at site. Complete remediation means that there are post-development sampling tests conducted on the remediated lands.</p><p>The geological and environmental testing of the site require sampling analyses from an accredited laboratory. The geological testing includes the investigations of the surface and subsurface soil stratification together with the geological conditions and the physical and mechanical properties of the ground materials. The environmental testing determines the presence and levels of heavy metals, hydrocarbons and their possible sources, pathways, and potential receptors.</p><p>The testing demonstrates the following requirements:</p><ul><li>The required geological and environmental testing of the site in accordance with the applicable standards.</li><li>The results of the sampling analyses from an accredited laboratory.</li></ul><p>The assessment report is the executive summary prepared by a specialist.

<p>The report demonstrates the following requirements:</p><ul><li>Ecological Conservation - describes the methods and measures on the conservation and management of ecologically valuable lands to prevent an adverse impact on biodiversity during the development of the project site.</li><li>Site Restoration - describes the methods and measures for restoring the previously developed or contaminated land into its original ecological state. This includes restoration of temporary construction areas and logistics into its previous condition.</li><li>Soil Contamination - describes any potential constraints of contaminated land to the development and includes the procedures and guidelines for soil management during excavation, soil sampling, and backfilling works.
