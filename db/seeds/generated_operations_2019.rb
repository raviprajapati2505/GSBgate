All of the building energy consumption occurs during the operational phase. As such, the operation of buildings contributes to 30-40% of total global energy use and associated CO2 emissions (UNIDO, 2009). Considering the building type and the local climate conditions, the major sources of energy consumption are cooling, heating, lighting, and the power consumed by the systems that support the building operation. The expected operational energy consumption is determined, mostly during the design phase, however, the energy efficiency can still be optimized during operations of the building through efficient facility management, retrofits/refurbishment and responsible occupant behavior. </p>\n<p>Energy efficiency for buildings can be achieved through various approaches for reducing energy consumption without affecting the comfort level of the occupants.

Baseline recommendations for selecting the U-Values of envelope elements can be found in international standards for different climatic zones. </p>\n            <p>- Retrofit, where required, all windows and skylights with low solar transmittance to control solar gain and reduce cooling load. Baseline recommendations for selecting the shading coefficient of windows and skylights can be found in international standards for different climatic zones.</p>\n            <p>- Increase roof surface reflectance and emittance using reflective paints, materials or coatings.</p>\n            <p>- Ensure that all the joints around the windows, skylights, doors, and junctions between walls and other structural elements, are airtight to minimize air leakage rates. </p>\n            <p>- Reduce solar gains using external shading devices where feasible.</p>\n            <p>- Reduce solar gains using mid pane blinds (where blinds are integrated between the panes of the double or triple glazing unit). They can be raised when solar gains and glare are not significant, and they can be lowered when solar gains and glare are evident.</p>\n            <p>- Use overhangs and fixed shading devices to control high angle summer sun on south facing elevations. Solar gains to east and west glazing are more difficult to control and will require adjustable shading devices.</p></li>\n        <li>Internal Loads<p>- Use daylighting provisions to decrease the minimum required energy intensity of lighting. This decreases the size of the equipment. However, when daylighting is utilized to reduce lighting electricity, the solar heat gain through glazing should be controlled, and in addition, glare and contrast must be controlled to provide a comfortable indoor environment. </p>\n            <p>- Use occupancy sensors to decrease the local lighting load. The use of occupancy sensors with manual-on and automatic-off control in daylit spaces, such as classrooms, offices, mechanical rooms, and restrooms, saves lighting energy. </p>\n            <p>- Use local articulated task lights (desk lamps that can be adjusted in three planes) in daylit spaces to decrease the lighting load and increase occupant satisfaction.</p>\n            <p>- Use more efficient interior lighting. Compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) and light-emitting-diodes (LEDs) reduce lighting electricity consumption and heat gains.</p>\n            <p>- Apply a comprehensive lighting management system, where external solar shading, internal shading, and artificial lighting are controlled in a holistic manner.</p></li>\n        <li>Cooling and Ventilation Systems<p>- Optimize the chiller selection by using variable speed chillers and pumping systems to ensure that system efficiency is maintained at lower loads. For primary-secondary pumping systems, it is more efficient to start the chillers one-by-one to ensure that there is more primary chilled water than secondary chilled water in the loop.</p>\n            <p>- Use the plant Direct Digital Control (DDC) system to start/stop chillers and use chiller controls (not the plant DDC system) to start/stop primary pumps to ensure additional energy savings.</p>\n            <p>- Use variable-speed-driven secondary pumps. This reduces pump energy by allowing each pump to operate at close to rated system head. This also improves balancing of the system and creates better part load performance.</p>\n            <p>- Use an energy recovery system to recover the heating or cooling from the exhaust air before discharging it outdoors.</p>\n            <p>- Use a variable air volume (VAV) system to reduce the chance of over-cooling or over-heating a space when it is not at its peak load condition. For specific applications, constant volume systems, such as fan coil units (FCUs), can be used to provide better performance. Such systems are more efficient due to their smaller size, multiple units, and limited control requirements. </p>\n            <p>- Provide local temperature sensors that can be controlled by a Building Management System (BMS) to avoid misuse of control features. </p>\n            <p>- Use direct digital control systems to optimize start-up or shut-down of the systems.</p>\n            <p>- Ensure that ventilation systems for a building designate the appropriate amount of outside air ventilation to the building, to provide a comfortable environment for occupants. Avoid an excessive amount of outside air which will result in a high level of energy consumption.</p>\n            <p>- Provide motorized dampers for stairs and elevator shafts to reduce the possibility of wasting conditioned air through these openings.</p>\n            <p>- Provide motorized dampers for all intake and relief/exhaust louvers and vents to protect the conditioned air from leaving the building and prevent unconditioned outdoor air from coming into the building.</p>\n            <p>- Use flow measuring stations at outdoor air intakes to the air handling units to control the quantity of the outdoor air.</p>\n            <p>- Use, where possible, one or more of the following control strategies to improve the efficiency of the system: chilled and condenser water reset, fan cycling, demand limiting, duty cycling, and fan pressure optimization at part load operation.</p>\n            <p>- Use, where applicable, high efficiency chillers to increase the chiller efficiency. Where the chilled water piping volume relative to the chiller capacity is small, provide an inertia or buffer tank to protect the chiller operation against extreme on-off cycling.</p>\n            <p>- Provide, where applicable, dedicated controlled exhaust systems for copy rooms to exhaust air from the room only when the copiers are functioning.</p>\n            <p>- Provide adequate air intake space for outdoor air-cooled equipment, such as cooling towers, to let them operate at the highest efficiency rating.</p>\n            <p>- Prevent stratification of return air and outside air within the mixing box to improve the air handling unit efficiency.</p></li>\n        <li>Heating System<p>- Ensure the most appropriate and efficient form of heating for a building depending on the use of the building. </p>\n            <p>- Use, where applicable, radiant heating for buildings which are used intermittently, or which have large air volumes (such as industrial units) as radiant heating may be an effective form of heating for such buildings. </p>\n            <p>- Use conventional central hot water systems for buildings which are used more regularly and with smaller air volumes, as these systems will be more effective. </p>\n            <p>- Use modular boilers for non-domestic buildings with varying loads, to prevent boilers operating at part load. </p>\n            <p>- Install time controls and set them to correctly reflect the hours of hot water requirement.</p>\n            <p>- Set sanitary hot water thermostats to the appropriate temperature; e.g. no more than 60°C for normal requirements (but ensure the water does not drop below 56°C to avoid health related issues).</p>\n            <p>- Switch off electric heating elements (immersion heaters) when hot water from the boiler is available;</p>\n            <p>- Replace any damaged or missing insulation from the entire hot water pipe work and cylinders through a periodic maintenance schedule. </p>\n            <p>- Use solar water heating which offers the most significant reduction in primary energy use.</p></li>\n        <li>Auxiliaries &amp; Plug-in Loads<p>- Select more energy efficient appliances to reduce the electricity requirements of plug loads and reduce heat gains from the use of appliances, office equipment, and other devices plugged into electrical outlets.</p>\n            <p>- Use switching off or enabling power down mode to reduce the energy consumption and heat produced by equipment, which in turn lowers the cooling load.</p>\n            <p>- Upgrade existing equipment with energy-efficient appliances which will generate savings over the lifetime of the equipment.</p>\n            <p>- Procure equipment with recognized energy labelling schemes. Some of the examples of the benefits of energy efficient equipment are as follows (UNIDO, 2009):</p>\n            <p>- Computers use up to 70% less electricity than computers without enabled power management;</p>\n            <p>- Monitors use up to 60 percent less electricity than standard models;</p>\n            <p>- Printers use at least 60 percent less electricity and must automatically enter a lower power setting after a period of inactivity;</p>\n            <p>- Refrigerators are at least 15% more efficient than standard models;</p>\n            <p>- TVs consume 3 watts or less when switched off, compared to a standard TV, which consumes almost 6 watts on average; and,</p>\n            <p>- LEDs use up to 90% less energy than a standard incandescent lamp.</p></li>\n        <li>Renewable Energy<p>Use of renewable energy reduces the use of primary fossil-based energy sources, thereby reducing the associated environmental footprints. Using photovoltaic cells to generate electricity can be an effective method for the generation of on-site electricity. PV cells are sources of renewable energy that convert sun energy directly into electricity using semiconductors. PV cells produce a direct current, which needs to be converted to an alternating current before it can be used in buildings. The common technique is to store direct current from PV cells in batteries and change it to an alternating current using an inverter. The major advantage of an alternating current created by the inverter is that the alternating current is compatible with the city utility grid. If the local PV system can generate additional electricity, the excess electricity can be transferred to the main utility grid and sold to the city electric provider, specifically when the city\n            grid experiences high demand from customers during certain times of the day.</p>\n            <p>Similarly, solar water heating and thermal or electrical energy generation using other renewable sources such as mini windmills, renewable biomass or geothermal sources help to reduce the environmental impact of primary fossil-based energy.</p></li>\n        <li>Energy Audit</li>\n    </ol>\n</li>\n<p>An energy audit conducted by the project owner/users is a systematic survey of all energy consuming appliances, fixtures, equipment, systems and practices in a building. A thorough energy audit is the basis of demand side and supply side energy efficiency improvement and sets the foundation for the energy management program within the organization. Specifically, an energy audit can:</p>\n<p>- Identify areas of excessive energy consumption, and opportunities for energy efficiency improvements;</p>\n<p>- Identify the degradation of energy performance in systems and equipment over time;</p>\n<p>- Form the basis for investment planning for energy efficiency improvement (identify best returns on investment); and, </p>\n<p>- Provide a benchmark for measuring energy efficiency program successes.</p>")

Baseline recommendations for selecting the U-Values of envelope elements can be found in international standards for different climatic zones. </p>\n            <p>- Retrofit, where required, all windows and skylights with low solar transmittance to control solar gain and reduce cooling load. Baseline recommendations for selecting the shading coefficient of windows and skylights can be found in international standards for different climatic zones.</p>\n            <p>- Increase roof surface reflectance and emittance using reflective paints, materials or coatings.</p>\n            <p>- Ensure that all the joints around the windows, skylights, doors, and junctions between walls and other structural elements, are airtight to minimize air leakage rates. </p>\n            <p>- Reduce solar gains using external shading devices where feasible.</p>\n            <p>- Reduce solar gains using mid pane blinds (where blinds are integrated between the panes of the double or triple glazing unit). They can be raised when solar gains and glare are not significant, and they can be lowered when solar gains and glare are evident.</p>\n            <p>- Use overhangs and fixed shading devices to control high angle summer sun on south facing elevations. Solar gains to east and west glazing are more difficult to control and will require adjustable shading devices.</p></li>\n        <li>Internal Loads<p>- Use daylighting provisions to decrease the minimum required energy intensity of lighting. This decreases the size of the equipment. However, when daylighting is utilized to reduce lighting electricity, the solar heat gain through glazing should be controlled, and in addition, glare and contrast must be controlled to provide a comfortable indoor environment. </p>\n            <p>- Use occupancy sensors to decrease the local lighting load. The use of occupancy sensors with manual-on and automatic-off control in daylit spaces, such as classrooms, offices, mechanical rooms, and restrooms, saves lighting energy. </p>\n            <p>- Use local articulated task lights (desk lamps that can be adjusted in three planes) in daylit spaces to decrease the lighting load and increase occupant satisfaction.</p>\n            <p>- Use more efficient interior lighting. Compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) and light-emitting-diodes (LEDs) reduce lighting electricity consumption and heat gains.</p>\n            <p>- Apply a comprehensive lighting management system, where external solar shading, internal shading, and artificial lighting are controlled in a holistic manner.</p></li>\n        <li>Cooling and Ventilation Systems<p>- Optimize the chiller selection by using variable speed chillers and pumping systems to ensure that system efficiency is maintained at lower loads. For primary-secondary pumping systems, it is more efficient to start the chillers one-by-one to ensure that there is more primary chilled water than secondary chilled water in the loop.</p>\n            <p>- Use the plant Direct Digital Control (DDC) system to start/stop chillers and use chiller controls (not the plant DDC system) to start/stop primary pumps to ensure additional energy savings.</p>\n            <p>- Use variable-speed-driven secondary pumps. This reduces pump energy by allowing each pump to operate at close to rated system head. This also improves balancing of the system and creates better part load performance.</p>\n            <p>- Use an energy recovery system to recover the heating or cooling from the exhaust air before discharging it outdoors.</p>\n            <p>- Use a variable air volume (VAV) system to reduce the chance of over-cooling or over-heating a space when it is not at its peak load condition. For specific applications, constant volume systems, such as fan coil units (FCUs), can be used to provide better performance. Such systems are more efficient due to their smaller size, multiple units, and limited control requirements. </p>\n            <p>- Provide local temperature sensors that can be controlled by a Building Management System (BMS) to avoid misuse of control features. </p>\n            <p>- Use direct digital control systems to optimize start-up or shut-down of the systems.</p>\n            <p>- Ensure that ventilation systems for a building designate the appropriate amount of outside air ventilation to the building, to provide a comfortable environment for occupants. Avoid an excessive amount of outside air which will result in a high level of energy consumption.</p>\n            <p>- Provide motorized dampers for stairs and elevator shafts to reduce the possibility of wasting conditioned air through these openings.</p>\n            <p>- Provide motorized dampers for all intake and relief/exhaust louvers and vents to protect the conditioned air from leaving the building and prevent unconditioned outdoor air from coming into the building.</p>\n            <p>- Use flow measuring stations at outdoor air intakes to the air handling units to control the quantity of the outdoor air.</p>\n            <p>- Use, where possible, one or more of the following control strategies to improve the efficiency of the system: chilled and condenser water reset, fan cycling, demand limiting, duty cycling, and fan pressure optimization at part load operation.</p>\n            <p>- Use, where applicable, high efficiency chillers to increase the chiller efficiency. Where the chilled water piping volume relative to the chiller capacity is small, provide an inertia or buffer tank to protect the chiller operation against extreme on-off cycling.</p>\n            <p>- Provide, where applicable, dedicated controlled exhaust systems for copy rooms to exhaust air from the room only when the copiers are functioning.</p>\n            <p>- Provide adequate air intake space for outdoor air-cooled equipment, such as cooling towers, to let them operate at the highest efficiency rating.</p>\n            <p>- Prevent stratification of return air and outside air within the mixing box to improve the air handling unit efficiency.</p></li>\n        <li>Heating System<p>- Ensure the most appropriate and efficient form of heating for a building depending on the use of the building. </p>\n            <p>- Use, where applicable, radiant heating for buildings which are used intermittently, or which have large air volumes (such as industrial units) as radiant heating may be an effective form of heating for such buildings. </p>\n            <p>- Use conventional central hot water systems for buildings which are used more regularly and with smaller air volumes, as these systems will be more effective. </p>\n            <p>- Use modular boilers for non-domestic buildings with varying loads, to prevent boilers operating at part load. </p>\n            <p>- Install time controls and set them to correctly reflect the hours of hot water requirement.</p>\n            <p>- Set sanitary hot water thermostats to the appropriate temperature; e.g. no more than 60°C for normal requirements (but ensure the water does not drop below 56°C to avoid health related issues).</p>\n            <p>- Switch off electric heating elements (immersion heaters) when hot water from the boiler is available;</p>\n            <p>- Replace any damaged or missing insulation from the entire hot water pipe work and cylinders through a periodic maintenance schedule. </p>\n            <p>- Use solar water heating which offers the most significant reduction in primary energy use.</p></li>\n        <li>Auxiliaries &amp; Plug-in Loads<p>- Select more energy efficient appliances to reduce the electricity requirements of plug loads and reduce heat gains from the use of appliances, office equipment, and other devices plugged into electrical outlets.</p>\n            <p>- Use switching off or enabling power down mode to reduce the energy consumption and heat produced by equipment, which in turn lowers the cooling load.</p>\n            <p>- Upgrade existing equipment with energy-efficient appliances which will generate savings over the lifetime of the equipment.</p>\n            <p>- Procure equipment with recognized energy labelling schemes. Some of the examples of the benefits of energy efficient equipment are as follows (UNIDO, 2009):</p>\n            <p>- Computers use up to 70% less electricity than computers without enabled power management;</p>\n            <p>- Monitors use up to 60 percent less electricity than standard models;</p>\n            <p>- Printers use at least 60 percent less electricity and must automatically enter a lower power setting after a period of inactivity;</p>\n            <p>- Refrigerators are at least 15% more efficient than standard models;</p>\n            <p>- TVs consume 3 watts or less when switched off, compared to a standard TV, which consumes almost 6 watts on average; and,</p>\n            <p>- LEDs use up to 90% less energy than a standard incandescent lamp.</p></li>\n        <li>Renewable Energy<p>Use of renewable energy reduces the use of primary fossil-based energy sources, thereby reducing the associated environmental footprints. Using photovoltaic cells to generate electricity can be an effective method for the generation of on-site electricity. PV cells are sources of renewable energy that convert sun energy directly into electricity using semiconductors. PV cells produce a direct current, which needs to be converted to an alternating current before it can be used in buildings. The common technique is to store direct current from PV cells in batteries and change it to an alternating current using an inverter. The major advantage of an alternating current created by the inverter is that the alternating current is compatible with the city utility grid. If the local PV system can generate additional electricity, the excess electricity can be transferred to the main utility grid and sold to the city electric provider, specifically when the city\n            grid experiences high demand from customers during certain times of the day.</p>\n            <p>Similarly, solar water heating and thermal or electrical energy generation using other renewable sources such as mini windmills, renewable biomass or geothermal sources help to reduce the environmental impact of primary fossil-based energy.</p></li>\n        <li>Energy Audit</li>\n    </ol>\n</li>\n<p>An energy audit conducted by the project owner/users is a systematic survey of all energy consuming appliances, fixtures, equipment, systems and practices in a building. A thorough energy audit is the basis of demand side and supply side energy efficiency improvement and sets the foundation for the energy management program within the organization. Specifically, an energy audit can:</p>\n<p>- Identify areas of excessive energy consumption, and opportunities for energy efficiency improvements;</p>\n<p>- Identify the degradation of energy performance in systems and equipment over time;</p>\n<p>- Form the basis for investment planning for energy efficiency improvement (identify best returns on investment); and, </p>\n<p>- Provide a benchmark for measuring energy efficiency program successes.</p>")

Such work can include disciplines such as painting, and decorating, carpentry, plumbing, glazing, plastering, and tiling and other such renovation works.</p></li>\n    <li>Manage Janitorial Services<p>Janitorial services include the regular cleaning of toilets, replenishing consumable items (such as toilet rolls, soap) and the uplift of litter. It is good practice for janitorial services to have a proactive response to the need for such actions. Schedule the cleaning as a series of periodic (daily, weekly, monthly) tasks. Sustainable and healthy practices are of prime importance for the health and wellbeing of occupants. Carefully select the type and chemical content of the materials used for janitorial services. </p></li>\n    <li>Manage Operational Performance<p>The FM department has responsibilities for the general day-to-day running of the building. These activities may be undertaken internally by employed staff or outsourced. This is often a policy issue, subject to the size and complexity of the organization. The immediacy of the response required in many of the activities involving the facilities manager will often require daily reports or an escalation procedure.</p>\n        <p>Some issues can require more than only periodic maintenance, for example those that can stop or obstruct the productivity of the business or that could have health and safety implications. </p></li>\n    <li>Manage Customer Needs<p>The receipt of occupant requests or complaints must be handled by a central point. This can be in the form of a help-desk enabling contact through telephone or email. The response to help desk calls can be prioritized based on the urgency of the issues raised. </p>\n        <p>The help desk can also be used to book meeting rooms, car parking spaces and many other services. This often depends on how the FM department is organized. </p></li>\n    <li>5.3.10 Manage Business Continuity Planning<p>All organizations should consider having a continuity plan in order that in the event of a fire, or major failure, the business can recover as quickly as possible and continue operating. In large organizations, staff could be relocated to another location that has been set up to reflect the existing operational model. The FM department is one of the key facilitators, should it be necessary to move the business to a recovery location.</p></li>\n    <li>5.3.11 Manage Space Allocation and Changes\n        <p>Office layouts are subject to frequent changes in many organizations. This process is referred to as ‘churn’ and the percentage of staff moved during a year is known as the ‘churn rate’. Such moves and change are normally planned by the FM department.

The resourcing plan should outline the staffing level, organization structure, roles and responsibilities, expertise, work schedule and resources.</p></li>\n    <li>Manage Environment, Health and Safety<p>The FM should control and manage many environmental and safety related issues of the organization. Failure to control and manage such issues can result in unhealthy conditions, occupants falling sick, injury, loss of business and the potential for prosecution and insurance claims. Customer and investor confidence in the organization might also be impacted through negative publicity from health and safety failures. </p></li>\n    <li>Manage Fire Safety<p>Fire represents one of the highest risks to loss of life. The potential damage to property could result in an organization totally shutting down its entire operations. The FM department ensures that there are systems and methods in place for the maintenance, inspection and testing of all the fire safety equipment and systems. The FM department keeps records and certificates of compliance where required.</p></li>\n    <li>Manage Security Services<p>The protection of occupants and the organization is frequently under the control of the FM department, in particular the maintenance of security software and hardware.

The resourcing plan should outline the staffing level, organization structure, roles and responsibilities, expertise, work schedule and resources.</p></li>\n    <li>Manage Environment, Health and Safety<p>The FM should control and manage many environmental and safety related issues of the organization. Failure to control and manage such issues can result in unhealthy conditions, occupants falling sick, injury, loss of business and the potential for prosecution and insurance claims. Customer and investor confidence in the organization might also be impacted through negative publicity from health and safety failures. </p></li>\n    <li>Manage Fire Safety<p>Fire represents one of the highest risks to loss of life. The potential damage to property could result in an organization totally shutting down its entire operations. The FM department ensures that there are systems and methods in place for the maintenance, inspection and testing of all the fire safety equipment and systems. The FM department keeps records and certificates of compliance where required.</p></li>\n    <li>Manage Security Services<p>The protection of occupants and the organization is frequently under the control of the FM department, in particular the maintenance of security software and hardware. This can also include manned guards should the organization require this level of additional security although such provision can be the responsibility of another department or outsourced. </p></li>\n    <li>Manage Maintenance, Testing and Inspections<p>The FM department ensures that the Operations &amp; Maintenance (O&amp;M) manuals for all systems and equipment specific to the organization are in a safe, accessible central location. Further, the FM department ensures the timely maintenance, testing and inspections are implemented within schedules to ensure that the facility and organization are operating safely and efficiently, and to maximize the lifespan of the systems and equipment to reduce the risk of failure. All works should meet the statutory obligations and requirements. Plan all works beforehand with the aid of relevant management tools or appropriate application software.</p></li>\n    <li>Manage Building Fabric Works<p>Building fabric includes all preventative, remedial and upgrade works required for the upkeep and improvement of buildings and their components. Such work can include disciplines such as painting, and decorating, carpentry, plumbing, glazing, plastering, and tiling and other such renovation works.</p></li>\n    <li>Manage Janitorial Services<p>Janitorial services include the regular cleaning of toilets, replenishing consumable items (such as toilet rolls, soap) and the uplift of litter. It is good practice for janitorial services to have a proactive response to the need for such actions. Schedule the cleaning as a series of periodic (daily, weekly, monthly) tasks. Sustainable and healthy practices are of prime importance for the health and wellbeing of occupants. Carefully select the type and chemical content of the materials used for janitorial services. </p></li>\n    <li>Manage Operational Performance<p>The FM department has responsibilities for the general day-to-day running of the building. These activities may be undertaken internally by employed staff or outsourced. This is often a policy issue, subject to the size and complexity of the organization. The immediacy of the response required in many of the activities involving the facilities manager will often require daily reports or an escalation procedure.</p>\n        <p>Some issues can require more than only periodic maintenance, for example those that can stop or obstruct the productivity of the business or that could have health and safety implications. </p></li>\n    <li>Manage Customer Needs<p>The receipt of occupant requests or complaints must be handled by a central point. This can be in the form of a help-desk enabling contact through telephone or email. The response to help desk calls can be prioritized based on the urgency of the issues raised. </p>\n        <p>The help desk can also be used to book meeting rooms, car parking spaces and many other services. This often depends on how the FM department is organized. </p></li>\n    <li>5.3.10 Manage Business Continuity Planning<p>All organizations should consider having a continuity plan in order that in the event of a fire, or major failure, the business can recover as quickly as possible and continue operating. In large organizations, staff could be relocated to another location that has been set up to reflect the existing operational model. The FM department is one of the key facilitators, should it be necessary to move the business to a recovery location.</p></li>\n    <li>5.3.11 Manage Space Allocation and Changes\n        <p>Office layouts are subject to frequent changes in many organizations. This process is referred to as ‘churn’ and the percentage of staff moved during a year is known as the ‘churn rate’. Such moves and change are normally planned by the FM department. In addition, consideration may also be given to vending, catering or staff restrooms and pantries. </p>\n    </li>\n</ol>")

It is important, however, for facility managers to ensure proper interpretation and use of feedback collected from the survey. As space design conditions could have significant variance from actual operating conditions, survey results are not a definitive means of determining whether the design engineer has succeeded in meeting expectations of the survey. Occupant psychosocial conditions can impose a strong influence on subjective assessments of the environment, that could render the assumed design parameters as invalid, and operating control modules may vary from those that the design engineer had anticipated. However, when properly used, occupant surveys are a direct method of assessing the noise level under given operating conditions and, thus, the optimum level of the acoustic comfort in the building.\n            Survey feedback can also help the Facility Manager enhance operations protocols and help building operators identify and address the reasons for dissatisfaction.</p></li>\n</ol>\n")

Individual work stations can be positioned relative to columns, walls, and each other to avoid uninterrupted sound paths between adjoining work stations. Occupant orientation is also important, as there is a significant difference between the sound level when someone talking faces the listener, versus someone talking facing away from the listener.</p>\n<p>- Locate problematic noise generation sources- computers, business machines, copiers, typewriters, and other noise generating devices in isolated (enclosed) rooms or areas to minimize noise intrusion into the work station. Where this is impractical, care should be exercised in eliminating or minimizing the noise generation aspects. Telephones and \"speaker phones\" are a frequent problem. The former should be equipped with flashing lights, rather than ringers (audible annunciators). </p>\n<p>- Select appropriate ceiling elements, such as return air grilles or fixtures, to avoid leakage of sound from the masking system or surface reflections of incident sounds. </p>\n<p>- Manage the sound generated within the work station and potentially intruding into adjacent work spaces through one of the following two ways: (1) using barriers that are properly absorptive and appropriately impervious to sound penetration; and (2) reducing the tendency of sound to \"flank\" or diffract around the perimeters of such barriers.</p>\n<p>- Treat vertical surfaces which are possible sound reflectors if not specifically treated. Hard, flat, smooth surfaces represent the worst condition. To reduce or eliminate these reflections, such surfaces should be highly absorptive to the sound of the frequency range that is of concern.</p>\n<p>- Control flanking transition by considering the height and length of the barrier, the horizontal distance between adjacent barriers, and the sound absorptive characteristics of the adjacent barriers. The most practical method of reducing flanking is to employ vertical barriers that are as high and as long, if possible. This may conflict with the desire for \"openness\" or clear view through the office space.</p>\n<p>- Ensure, if applicable, that the barrier height is more than 1.5m as below this height is ineffective for acoustical barriers in open plan offices. As a general rule, barrier heights greater than 2 m provide diminishing returns. \"Trade-off\" decisions, in the determination of the required height against the original motive for considering the aesthetic factors associated with such systems, are required. </p>\n<p>- Consider using acoustic ceiling tiles and wall panels or spray-on acoustic treatments in spaces where additional sound absorption is necessary.</p>\n<p>- Provide sufficient noise insulation to mitigate impacts from interior noise sources such as those generated by plumbing systems, mechanical ventilation systems, and air conditioning equipment. </p>\n<p>- Minimize excessive vibration from services and equipment as per the latest ISO standard or equivalent, to mitigate acoustic problems in the building interior. </p>\n<p>- Consider the use of soft, sound absorbent materials for interior finishes including walls, floors, and ceilings to reduce noise levels. A higher sound absorption rate will attenuate noise transferred from the exterior, or generated within the building, and will increase the acoustic performance within the building. </p>\n<p>- Consider the floor impact sound level and the performance of sound insulation as related to impact noises both heavy and light.

Where variables are going to be trended, successful air quality control is a function of steady-state performance. Steady-state requires that the trended variables remain within a specified range without remarkable fluctuations. </p>\n        <p><span>Measurements Considerations</span></p>\n        <p>- Operating conditions: Take measurements under all expected operating conditions, i.e. peak vs non-peak for the pollutants. Remarkable fluctuations in readings should be examined in relation to the indoor/outdoor polluting sources conditions.</p>\n        <p>- Measuring devices: Ensure measuring devices are suitable for accurately measuring the required environmental parameters. Continuous online monitoring software packages offer reliable on-demand sources of information. Maintain up-to-date calibration of devices at all times. </p>\n        <p>- Measurement location: Ensure that measurement locations for large buildings with multiple zoning represent the worst case in predominantly occupied spaces. </p>\n        <p>- Measurements period: Take measurements in accordance with WHO or US-EPA recommended protocols. </p>\n        <p>- Frequency of On-Site Measurements: On-site measurements for each of the variables should be conducted during the certification period for the predominantly occupied spaces. An additional Air Quality Validation Audit for on-site measurement conducted by GSAS Trust is required after two years from certificate issuance.</p></li>\n    <li>Occupant Survey<p>The objective of the occupant survey is to evaluate if the perceived ventilation in a room, building, etc., is acceptable to the majority of occupants. It is important, however, for facility managers to ensure proper interpretation and use of feedback collected from the survey. As space design conditions could have significant variance from actual operating conditions, survey results are not a definitive means of determining whether the design engineer has succeeded in meeting the expectations of the survey. Occupant psychosocial conditions can impose a strong influence on subjective assessments of the environment, that could render the assumed design parameters as invalid, and operating control modules may vary from those that the design engineer had anticipated. However, when properly used, occupant surveys are a direct method of assessing air quality under given\n        operating conditions and, thus the adequacy of the ventilation in the building. Survey feedback can also help the Facility Manager enhance operations protocols and help building operators identify and address the reasons for dissatisfaction.</p>\n        <p><span>Frequency of Surveys</span></p>\n        <p>Surveys should be conducted for the occupants in predominantly occupied spaces during the same period in which on-site measurements are conducted.</p></li>\n    <li>Indoor Air Quality Procedure (IAQP)\n        <p>For laboratory, industrial and other spaces where contaminants of concern do exist in addition to the above, the Indoor Air Quality Procedure (IAQP) of ASHRAE standard can be followed to help meet the targets for indoor air concentrations and occupant satisfaction. IAQP is a performance-based design approach, in which the building and the Air-Conditioning and Mechanical Ventilation (ACMV) systems are designed to maintain the concentrations of specific contaminants, within certain limits, to achieve the IAQP target level of indoor air quality acceptable to building occupants and/or visitors. Refer to the ASHRAE standard for more information on the compliance requirements of this procedure. </p>\n        <p>The IAQP includes:</p>\n        <p>- the list of contaminants and contaminant mixtures of concern considered in the design process;</p>\n        <p>- a table of the sources and emission rates of the contaminants of concern;</p>\n        <p>- a table of the concentration limits and exposure periods and the references for these limits;</p>\n        <p>- a report on the analytical approach used in determining the air quality rates and air-cleaning requirements;</p>\n        <p>- printout of the contaminants data loggers.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n")

The first requirement is the air in the breathing zones should conform to the local health standards tolerance for a health risk. The second requirement is the supply air and recirculated air in the space, as perceived by occupants, must be fresh and pleasant rather than stale, stuffy and irritating. </p>\n<p>With prolonged exposure, there are indoor air pollutants that could pose certain health risks to human beings. The health risks associated comprise distinct, acute, or long-term adverse effects.</p>\n<p>It is important to have efficient and properly functioning air-conditioning and mechanical ventilation systems in the building to maintain the desired indoor air quality control. The quality of the indoor air can greatly impact the incidence of respiratory diseases, the symptoms of allergies and asthma, the transmission of infectious diseases, chemical sensitivity and occupant productivity. High-efficiency particulate air filters can significantly reduce the risk of airborne pollutants, thus reducing the infection rates of a wide range of other aerosolized pathogens.</p>\n<p>A higher indoor CO2 concentration level, due to inadequate ventilation, is associated with building occupants experiencing a tendency to be less satisfied with indoor air quality, as they report more acute health symptoms (e.g., headache, mucosal irritation). It is argued that higher levels of various indoor-generated pollutants that directly cause the adverse effects, are correlated with when higher indoor CO2 concentrations occur at lower outdoor air ventilation rates. </p>\n<p>Indoor air quality in a building is not constant. It is influenced by changes in building operation, occupant activity and outdoor climate. Pollutant sources include building materials, furniture, office equipment, human metabolism and outdoor air. Among different pollutants several substances are of special concern for human health including Carbon Monoxide (CO), Nitrogen Oxides (NO <span>X</span>), Sulfur Oxide (SO <span>X</span>), Formaldehyde, Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC’s), particulate matters (PM2.5), Ozone (O3), metabolic gases, micro-organisms and airborne bacteria.</p>\n<p>The biological quality of air in sensitive buildings such as healthcare facilities, wellness centers and schools is of particular concern as such facilities are susceptible for the spread of pathogenic bacteria. The transmission of airborne bacteria is highly affected by the overall environment including air contaminants. For example, research examining indoor air pollutants in the food service sector observed a positive correlation between particulate matters (PM), total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and kidney inflammation. Common sources of aerosol transmission in hospitals include respiratory discharge from the mouth and nose, skin exudates and infected wounds, which may infect the occupants through transmission means such as respiratory apparatus and air-conditioning. Therefore, considerable attention is needed in operating such buildings towards controlling pathogenic bacteria. </p>\n<p>Indoor air quality may be controlled by a combination of source control and ventilation. </p>\n<p>Humans produce Carbon Dioxide (CO2) proportional to their metabolic rate. At low concentrations, typically occurring indoors, CO2 is harmless to humans. It is a good indicator of the concentration of other human bio effluents being perceived as a nuisance. In addition, other pollution sources or hazardous air pollutants such as CO, NOx, PM2.5, SOx, O3 and VOC’s must be considered in assessing the indoor air quality.</p>\n<p>ASHRAE has defined the acceptable indoor air quality as the air in which there are no known contaminants at harmful concentrations, as determined by local regulations, and with which a substantial majority (80% or more) of the people exposed do not express dissatisfaction.</p>\n<p>Methods and measures listed below work best when they are implemented in the design stage. However, during maintenance, renovations and retrofitting various improvements in ventilation can be implemented, depending on the intent of the upgrades and allocated budget.</p>")

Based on research studies among staff, daylight has been associated with reduced stress, improved performance and reduced errors, reduced absenteeism, increased positive attitude, reduced fatigue and improved job satisfaction. In addition, daylight provides contact with the outside living environment and improves circadian rhythms by affecting melatonin production and regulation. Also, windows provide a feeling of closeness to the surroundings and atmosphere. </p>\n<p>The average daylight factor is influenced by building form, size and area of windows in relation to the room, the light transmittance of the glass, how bright internal surfaces and finishes are, the presence of overhangs and other external obstructions which may restrict the amount of daylight entering the room.</p>\n<p>Building geometry and interior space planning should promote, rather than preclude, the distribution of daylight. Based on the building form, side-lighting is considered the primary way of introducing daylight into buildings. Besides supplying light, side lighting through windows can provide view, create orientation, allow connectivity to the outdoors and allow ventilation during less harsh times of the year. The size and proportion of windows should depend on the amount of daylight required, type of view, the size of the internal space, and the position and mobility of occupants. When windows are confined to one wall only, it is recommended that the total width of the windows range between 25-50% of the length of the wall to offer the optimum viewing opportunity. Additionally, window glass selection, reflectance of interior finishes and the interior layout play a role in enhancing the illuminance of the work place.</p>\n<p>Top lighting is when daylight penetrates a building from above the ceiling plane or is concentrated in the roof. Top lighting can provide greater freedom of source placement to achieve more uniform illumination and takes advantage of high wall surfaces and other architectural elements to distribute light where required. Common top lighting strategies including skylights, courtyards, lightwells and atria. </p>\n<p>Sunlight should be admitted unless it is likely to cause thermal or visual discomfort to the users, or deterioration of materials. Generally, sunlight should not fall on visual tasks or directly on people at work. It should, on the other hand, be used to enhance the overall brightness of interiors with patches of high illuminance. Interiors in which the occupants have a reasonable expectation of direct sunlight should receive at least 25% of probable sunlight hours. It is the duration of sunlight in an interior, rather than the intensity or the size of the sunny patch, which correlates best with occupant satisfaction. However, adequate measures should be taken for controlling glare while designing to maximize daylight in buildings. </p>\n<p>Glare. Distraction, a poor luminance balance between task and background, and discomfort glare can all occur if the visual task is viewed directly against the bright sky. Although a view outside should be provided, it is usually improved if the glazing is at the side of workers, rather than directly facing them. Glare from the sun, viewed directly or reflected, can be unacceptable in a working environment. Low transmittance glazing is unlikely to attenuate the beam sufficiently to eliminate glare; diffusing glazing materials, in scattering the beam, may cause the window or roof light itself to become an unacceptably bright source of light.</p>\n<p>Views. Unless an activity requires the exclusion of daylight, a view out-of-doors should be provided irrespective of its quality. Most people prefer a view of a natural scene: trees, grass, plants and open space. All occupants of a building should have the opportunity for the refreshment and relaxation afforded by a change of scene and focus. Even a limited view to the outside can be valuable. If an external view cannot be provided, occupants should have an internal view possessing some of the qualities of a view outdoors, for example, into an atrium.</p>\n<p>For interior zones where no direct daylight is provided the indoor nature exposure (INE) that replicates nature including plant-based features, organic textures, fish tanks, live or artificial plants, nature photography or art and sounds and aromas can be considered potential means of improving health and creating health-promoting environments. In particular, studies have shown that plants offer a guarantee of enhancing perception and contribute to wellbeing and that people perceive buildings with interior planting to be more welcoming and more relaxed. </p>")

Occupant psychosocial conditions can impose a strong influence on subjective assessments of the environment, that could render the assumed design parameters as invalid, and operating control modules may vary from those that the design engineer had anticipated. However, when properly used, occupant surveys are a direct method of assessment under given operating conditions and thus the optimum level of thermal\n                comfort in the building.

It is important, however, for facility managers to ensure proper interpretation and use of feedback collected from the survey. As space design conditions could have significant variance from actual operating conditions, survey results are not a definitive means of determining whether the design engineer has succeeded in meeting expectations of the survey. Occupant psychosocial conditions can impose a strong influence on subjective assessments of the environment, that could render the assumed design parameters as invalid, and operating control modules may vary from those that the design engineer had anticipated. However, when properly used, occupant surveys are a direct method of assessing the noise level under given operating conditions and, thus, the optimum level of the acoustic comfort in the building.\n            Survey feedback can also help the Facility Manager enhance operations protocols and help building operators identify and address the reasons for dissatisfaction.</p></li>\n</ol>\n")

Individual work stations can be positioned relative to columns, walls, and each other to avoid uninterrupted sound paths between adjoining work stations. Occupant orientation is also important, as there is a significant difference between the sound level when someone talking faces the listener, versus someone talking facing away from the listener.</p>\n<p>- Locate problematic noise generation sources- computers, business machines, copiers, typewriters, and other noise generating devices in isolated (enclosed) rooms or areas to minimize noise intrusion into the work station. Where this is impractical, care should be exercised in eliminating or minimizing the noise generation aspects. Telephones and \"speaker phones\" are a frequent problem. The former should be equipped with flashing lights, rather than ringers (audible annunciators). </p>\n<p>- Select appropriate ceiling elements, such as return air grilles or fixtures, to avoid leakage of sound from the masking system or surface reflections of incident sounds. </p>\n<p>- Manage the sound generated within the work station and potentially intruding into adjacent work spaces through one of the following two ways: (1) using barriers that are properly absorptive and appropriately impervious to sound penetration; and (2) reducing the tendency of sound to \"flank\" or diffract around the perimeters of such barriers.</p>\n<p>- Treat vertical surfaces which are possible sound reflectors if not specifically treated. Hard, flat, smooth surfaces represent the worst condition. To reduce or eliminate these reflections, such surfaces should be highly absorptive to the sound of the frequency range that is of concern.</p>\n<p>- Control flanking transition by considering the height and length of the barrier, the horizontal distance between adjacent barriers, and the sound absorptive characteristics of the adjacent barriers. The most practical method of reducing flanking is to employ vertical barriers that are as high and as long, if possible. This may conflict with the desire for \"openness\" or clear view through the office space.</p>\n<p>- Ensure, if applicable, that the barrier height is more than 1.5m as below this height is ineffective for acoustical barriers in open plan offices. As a general rule, barrier heights greater than 2 m provide diminishing returns. \"Trade-off\" decisions, in the determination of the required height against the original motive for considering the aesthetic factors associated with such systems, are required. </p>\n<p>- Consider using acoustic ceiling tiles and wall panels or spray-on acoustic treatments in spaces where additional sound absorption is necessary.</p>\n<p>- Provide sufficient noise insulation to mitigate impacts from interior noise sources such as those generated by plumbing systems, mechanical ventilation systems, and air conditioning equipment. </p>\n<p>- Minimize excessive vibration from services and equipment as per the latest ISO standard or equivalent, to mitigate acoustic problems in the building interior. </p>\n<p>- Consider the use of soft, sound absorbent materials for interior finishes including walls, floors, and ceilings to reduce noise levels. A higher sound absorption rate will attenuate noise transferred from the exterior, or generated within the building, and will increase the acoustic performance within the building. </p>\n<p>- Consider the floor impact sound level and the performance of sound insulation as related to impact noises both heavy and light. An example of light floor impact noise is a light weight plastic chair being dragged on a concrete floor, whereas a heavy floor impact noise might be the sound of children jumping. </p>\n<p>- Ensure the use of materials with appropriate Impact Insulation Class (IIC) (a measure of the impact of sound insulation of a floor/ceiling) to provide the proper acoustic performance levels for interior spaces.</p>\n")

Where variables are going to be trended, successful air quality control is a function of steady-state performance. Steady-state requires that the trended variables remain within a specified range without remarkable fluctuations. </p>\n        <p><span>Measurements Considerations</span></p>\n        <p>- Operating conditions: Take measurements under all expected operating conditions, i.e. peak vs non-peak for the pollutants. Remarkable fluctuations in readings should be examined in relation to the indoor/outdoor polluting sources conditions.</p>\n        <p>- Measuring devices: Ensure measuring devices are suitable for accurately measuring the required environmental parameters. Continuous online monitoring software packages offer reliable on-demand sources of information. Maintain up-to-date calibration of devices at all times. </p>\n        <p>- Measurement location: Ensure that measurement locations for large buildings with multiple zoning represent the worst case in predominantly occupied spaces. </p>\n        <p>- Measurements period: Take measurements in accordance with WHO or US-EPA recommended protocols. </p>\n        <p>- Frequency of On-Site Measurements: On-site measurements for each of the variables should be conducted during the certification period for the predominantly occupied spaces. An additional Air Quality Validation Audit for on-site measurement conducted by GSAS Trust is required after two years from certificate issuance.</p></li>\n    <li>Occupant Survey<p>The objective of the occupant survey is to evaluate if the perceived ventilation in a room, building, etc., is acceptable to the majority of occupants. It is important, however, for facility managers to ensure proper interpretation and use of feedback collected from the survey. As space design conditions could have significant variance from actual operating conditions, survey results are not a definitive means of determining whether the design engineer has succeeded in meeting the expectations of the survey. Occupant psychosocial conditions can impose a strong influence on subjective assessments of the environment, that could render the assumed design parameters as invalid, and operating control modules may vary from those that the design engineer had anticipated. However, when properly used, occupant surveys are a direct method of assessing air quality under given\n        operating conditions and, thus the adequacy of the ventilation in the building. Survey feedback can also help the Facility Manager enhance operations protocols and help building operators identify and address the reasons for dissatisfaction.</p>\n        <p><span>Frequency of Surveys</span></p>\n        <p>Surveys should be conducted for the occupants in predominantly occupied spaces during the same period in which on-site measurements are conducted.</p></li>\n    <li>Indoor Air Quality Procedure (IAQP)\n        <p>For laboratory, industrial and other spaces where contaminants of concern do exist in addition to the above, the Indoor Air Quality Procedure (IAQP) of ASHRAE standard can be followed to help meet the targets for indoor air concentrations and occupant satisfaction. IAQP is a performance-based design approach, in which the building and the Air-Conditioning and Mechanical Ventilation (ACMV) systems are designed to maintain the concentrations of specific contaminants, within certain limits, to achieve the IAQP target level of indoor air quality acceptable to building occupants and/or visitors. Refer to the ASHRAE standard for more information on the compliance requirements of this procedure. </p>\n        <p>The IAQP includes:</p>\n        <p>- the list of contaminants and contaminant mixtures of concern considered in the design process;</p>\n        <p>- a table of the sources and emission rates of the contaminants of concern;</p>\n        <p>- a table of the concentration limits and exposure periods and the references for these limits;</p>\n        <p>- a report on the analytical approach used in determining the air quality rates and air-cleaning requirements;</p>\n        <p>- printout of the contaminants data loggers.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n")

The first requirement is the air in the breathing zones should conform to the local health standards tolerance for a health risk. The second requirement is the supply air and recirculated air in the space, as perceived by occupants, must be fresh and pleasant rather than stale, stuffy and irritating. </p>\n<p>With prolonged exposure, there are indoor air pollutants that could pose certain health risks to human beings. The health risks associated comprise distinct, acute, or long-term adverse effects.</p>\n<p>It is important to have efficient and properly functioning air-conditioning and mechanical ventilation systems in the building to maintain the desired indoor air quality control. The quality of the indoor air can greatly impact the incidence of respiratory diseases, the symptoms of allergies and asthma, the transmission of infectious diseases, chemical sensitivity and occupant productivity. High-efficiency particulate air filters can significantly reduce the risk of airborne pollutants, thus reducing the infection rates of a wide range of other aerosolized pathogens.</p>\n<p>A higher indoor CO2 concentration level, due to inadequate ventilation, is associated with building occupants experiencing a tendency to be less satisfied with indoor air quality, as they report more acute health symptoms (e.g., headache, mucosal irritation). It is argued that higher levels of various indoor-generated pollutants that directly cause the adverse effects, are correlated with when higher indoor CO2 concentrations occur at lower outdoor air ventilation rates. </p>\n<p>Indoor air quality in a building is not constant. It is influenced by changes in building operation, occupant activity and outdoor climate. Pollutant sources include building materials, furniture, office equipment, human metabolism and outdoor air. Among different pollutants several substances are of special concern for human health including Carbon Monoxide (CO), Nitrogen Oxides (NO <span>X</span>), Sulfur Oxide (SO <span>X</span>), Formaldehyde, Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC’s), particulate matters (PM2.5), Ozone (O3), metabolic gases, micro-organisms and airborne bacteria.</p>\n<p>The biological quality of air in sensitive buildings such as healthcare facilities, wellness centers and schools is of particular concern as such facilities are susceptible for the spread of pathogenic bacteria. The transmission of airborne bacteria is highly affected by the overall environment including air contaminants. For example, research examining indoor air pollutants in the food service sector observed a positive correlation between particulate matters (PM), total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and kidney inflammation. Common sources of aerosol transmission in hospitals include respiratory discharge from the mouth and nose, skin exudates and infected wounds, which may infect the occupants through transmission means such as respiratory apparatus and air-conditioning. Therefore, considerable attention is needed in operating such buildings towards controlling pathogenic bacteria. </p>\n<p>Indoor air quality may be controlled by a combination of source control and ventilation. </p>\n<p>Humans produce Carbon Dioxide (CO2) proportional to their metabolic rate. At low concentrations, typically occurring indoors, CO2 is harmless to humans. It is a good indicator of the concentration of other human bio effluents being perceived as a nuisance. In addition, other pollution sources or hazardous air pollutants such as CO, NOx, PM2.5, SOx, O3 and VOC’s must be considered in assessing the indoor air quality.</p>\n<p>ASHRAE has defined the acceptable indoor air quality as the air in which there are no known contaminants at harmful concentrations, as determined by local regulations, and with which a substantial majority (80% or more) of the people exposed do not express dissatisfaction.</p>\n<p>Methods and measures listed below work best when they are implemented in the design stage. However, during maintenance, renovations and retrofitting various improvements in ventilation can be implemented, depending on the intent of the upgrades and allocated budget.</p>")

Based on research studies among staff, daylight has been associated with reduced stress, improved performance and reduced errors, reduced absenteeism, increased positive attitude, reduced fatigue and improved job satisfaction. In addition, daylight provides contact with the outside living environment and improves circadian rhythms by affecting melatonin production and regulation. Also, windows provide a feeling of closeness to the surroundings and atmosphere. </p>\n<p>The average daylight factor is influenced by building form, size and area of windows in relation to the room, the light transmittance of the glass, how bright internal surfaces and finishes are, the presence of overhangs and other external obstructions which may restrict the amount of daylight entering the room.</p>\n<p>Building geometry and interior space planning should promote, rather than preclude, the distribution of daylight. Based on the building form, side-lighting is considered the primary way of introducing daylight into buildings. Besides supplying light, side lighting through windows can provide view, create orientation, allow connectivity to the outdoors and allow ventilation during less harsh times of the year. The size and proportion of windows should depend on the amount of daylight required, type of view, the size of the internal space, and the position and mobility of occupants. When windows are confined to one wall only, it is recommended that the total width of the windows range between 25-50% of the length of the wall to offer the optimum viewing opportunity. Additionally, window glass selection, reflectance of interior finishes and the interior layout play a role in enhancing the illuminance of the work place.</p>\n<p>Top lighting is when daylight penetrates a building from above the ceiling plane or is concentrated in the roof. Top lighting can provide greater freedom of source placement to achieve more uniform illumination and takes advantage of high wall surfaces and other architectural elements to distribute light where required. Common top lighting strategies including skylights, courtyards, lightwells and atria. </p>\n<p>Sunlight should be admitted unless it is likely to cause thermal or visual discomfort to the users, or deterioration of materials. Generally, sunlight should not fall on visual tasks or directly on people at work. It should, on the other hand, be used to enhance the overall brightness of interiors with patches of high illuminance. Interiors in which the occupants have a reasonable expectation of direct sunlight should receive at least 25% of probable sunlight hours. It is the duration of sunlight in an interior, rather than the intensity or the size of the sunny patch, which correlates best with occupant satisfaction. However, adequate measures should be taken for controlling glare while designing to maximize daylight in buildings. </p>\n<p>Glare. Distraction, a poor luminance balance between task and background, and discomfort glare can all occur if the visual task is viewed directly against the bright sky. Although a view outside should be provided, it is usually improved if the glazing is at the side of workers, rather than directly facing them. Glare from the sun, viewed directly or reflected, can be unacceptable in a working environment. Low transmittance glazing is unlikely to attenuate the beam sufficiently to eliminate glare; diffusing glazing materials, in scattering the beam, may cause the window or roof light itself to become an unacceptably bright source of light.</p>\n<p>Views. Unless an activity requires the exclusion of daylight, a view out-of-doors should be provided irrespective of its quality. Most people prefer a view of a natural scene: trees, grass, plants and open space. All occupants of a building should have the opportunity for the refreshment and relaxation afforded by a change of scene and focus. Even a limited view to the outside can be valuable. If an external view cannot be provided, occupants should have an internal view possessing some of the qualities of a view outdoors, for example, into an atrium.</p>\n<p>For interior zones where no direct daylight is provided the indoor nature exposure (INE) that replicates nature including plant-based features, organic textures, fish tanks, live or artificial plants, nature photography or art and sounds and aromas can be considered potential means of improving health and creating health-promoting environments. In particular, studies have shown that plants offer a guarantee of enhancing perception and contribute to wellbeing and that people perceive buildings with interior planting to be more welcoming and more relaxed. </p>")

Thus, it is important to recognize the effects of the intensity and timing of light on different user groups.</p>\n<p>Aspects that would normally be considered for ensuring a high quality of visual performance include levels of illumination; uniformity and ratios of illuminance; glare; color and room reflectance; energy efficiency; and other special considerations.</p>\n<p>The illuminance values recommended by established standards are valid for normal visual conditions and consider the following factors: psycho-physiological aspects including visual; comfort and well-being; visual task requirements; visual ergonomics; practical experience; contribution to functional safety; and economic impact.</p>\n<p>The illuminance should be maintained at higher levels when: visual work is critical; errors are costly to rectify; accuracy, higher productivity or increased concentration is of great importance; task details are of unusually small size or low contrast; the task is undertaken for an unusually long time; and the visual capacity of the occupant is below normal.</p>")

As space design conditions could have significant variance from actual operating conditions, survey results are not a definitive means of determining whether the design engineer has succeeded in meeting the expectations of the survey. Occupant psychosocial conditions can impose a strong influence on subjective assessments of the environment, that could render the assumed design parameters as invalid, and operating control modules may vary from those that the design engineer had anticipated. However, when properly used, occupant surveys are a direct method of assessment under given operating conditions and thus the optimum level of thermal\n                comfort in the building. Survey feedback can also help the Facility Manager enhance operations protocols and help building operators identify and address the reasons for dissatisfaction.</p>\n        </li>\n    </ol>\n</li>\n")

Similarly, work-related fatigue is higher at higher relative humidity (e.g. 70% RH) compared with a lower relative humidity (30-40% RH). </p>\n<p>It is evident that occupied space needs to be thermally comfortable for occupants to function at full capability. However, thermal comfort is based on thermal adaptation of the individual occupant which is correlated to factors such as geographic location and climate, time of year, gender, race, and age. </p>\n<p>Thermal discomfort occurs when the thermal environment does not meet the requirements of the human mind or body. In warm environments perspiration will start, possibly leading to hyperthermia in extreme cases. On the other hand, in cold environments, occupants feel cold, the temperature of their hands and feet drop substantially; and in extreme cases may result in hypothermia. All these responses are reactions to uncomfortable environments. </p>\n<p>Provision of the means to control parameters of thermal comfort is a key factor.

Such increases are attributed to climate change, population growth and economic development, with associated increases in irrigation, domestic and industrial water requirements.</p>\n<p>Water conservation is becoming a viable alternative and is complementary to developing new water supplies. It involves a combination of retrofits, an upgrade of water related equipment and fixtures, the maintenance of infrastructure, and a collective water conservation ethic focused on resource use, allocation, and protection. There are ample opportunities in all types of buildings to achieve significant water savings, indoors and outdoors, by making improvements in several operational areas.</p>\n<p>Water saving in buildings can be achieved through various approaches while maintaining the level of comfort for occupants. Key areas to be addressed are as follows:</p>\n<p>- Monitoring of Water Use and Leak Detection;</p>\n<p>- Sanitary Fixtures and Equipment;</p>\n<p>- Outdoor Water Use;</p>\n<p>- On-Site Alternative Water Sources; </p>\n<p>The methods and measures listed below work best when they are implemented in the design stage. However, during maintenance, renovations or retrofitting various aspects of improvements can be pursued depending on the intent of the upgrades and allocated budget.</p>")

Monitor and record water meter readings between peak and off-peak hours to establish if leaks are occurring within the water distribution system.</p>\n            <p>- Install fail-safe control devices, or leak detection systems, on major water-using equipment or distribution lines.</p>\n            <p>- Conduct visual and detection and alarm system inspections of the facility on a periodic basis. </p>\n            <p>- Perform random and routine visits in the building, including visual inspections of the ceilings and floors, toilets, kitchens, plantrooms and other spaces where possible water accumulations could occur due to water leaks. </p>\n            <p>- Provide information campaign materials to building occupants, employees, and visitors to immediately report to facility maintenance staff any leaks that have been observed in private restrooms, kitchen areas, or any part of the facility.</p></li>\n        <li>Sanitary Fixtures and Equipment<p>- Verify and identify inefficient water fixtures. Replace water closets and flush valves with models that meet GSAS requirements for water efficiency. While current codes require the lower flow rate for new fixtures, existing buildings often use older, high-flow flush valves. </p>\n            <p>- Replace existing plumbing fixtures with water-efficient fixtures. In most cases, fixtures and valves will need to be replaced to ensure proper operation of the fixture and reduce the chance of clogging.</p>\n            <p>- Utilize dual-flush valves on water closets. For example, dual-flush valves provide a full 6.0-lpf flush and an optional 3.0-lpf half flush.</p>\n            <p>- Install water-efficient urinals, which use as little as half a liter of water per flush, or less than 10 percent of current low-flow models, especially in densely populated areas.</p>\n            <p>- Install or replace existing lavatory faucets and sink aerators with more restrictive and high efficiency aerators.</p>\n            <p>- Use treated grey water supply systems as an alternative water source for use in water closets and urinals. The use of grey water can considerably reduce consumption of domestic water.</p>\n            <p>- Maintain and operate laundry and dishwashing equipment to its optimum capacity. Check and repair any leaks and damaged components for efficient operation.</p>\n            <p>- Install appliances with technologies that can significantly reduce water and energy use. </p></li>\n        <li>Outdoor Water Use<p>- Periodically review all landscape service and maintenance contracts. Update the requirements for water-efficiency where applicable.</p>\n            <p>- Maintain a sufficient quantity of good topsoil to capture precipitation as it falls and to release water back to plants over time, reducing irrigation requirements. </p>\n            <p>- Add mulch to plant beds to cover bare soil. Re-mulch areas annually to maintain soil coverage and prevent erosion.</p>\n            <p>- Keep the irrigated landscape trimmed and free of weeds.</p>\n            <p>- Provide structured shaded areas in the overall landscape design to reduce the water needs of surrounding plants. </p>\n            <p>- Use water-efficient engineered systems for water feature recirculating systems. Maintain and operate water recirculation systems periodically for leaks and other damage. Where feasible, use recycled water in water features.</p>\n            <p>- Avoid using fresh water to dust-sweep the grounds or floors of outdoor areas, such as driveways and walkways, parking lots, playing courts, hard decks and courtyards, or other hardscapes. Use alternative means, such as brooms and pans to dust-clean these outdoor areas to conserve water.</p>\n            <p>- Ensure the irrigation schedule is appropriate for the climate conditions, soil conditions, plant species, grading, and season.</p>\n            <p>- Check that the sprinkler components are installed and calibrated such that the supplied water is irrigating the plants and not the pavements or roadways. </p>\n            <p>- Require a full audit of the irrigation system on a periodic basis. A full audit should include an in-depth assessment of the irrigation system, performance, and schedule. </p>\n            <p>- Ensure efficient grouping of plants with similar irrigation needs using a hydrozoning technique in consultation with field experts. </p>\n            <p>- Specify plants and irrigation systems that can significantly lower the volume of water needed to sustain the landscape. Refer to GSAS D&amp;B manual for plant types and irrigation methods that could meet the water budget based on the local climate. The Water Budget Tool can help evaluate the relative water savings that can be achieved with a different plant palette and technology choices.</p>\n            <p>- Use other alternative water sources, where feasible, as a substitute for potable water sources for irrigation. </p>\n            <p>- Utilize bushes, mulch, rain gardens, permeable hardscape, or curb cuts in parking lot islands or in the areas between sidewalks and the roadway for water run-offs.</p>\n            <p>- Check and maintain water features regularly to ensure they are continuously operating at optimum capacity. Use an engineered recirculating system, designed and tested to operate with an optimized water flow rate and energy use.</p>\n            <p>- Consult with landscape professionals, preferably trained and certified, but more importantly with working experience on practical applications of water-efficient and climate-appropriate landscaping works.</p></li>\n        <li>Onsite Alternative Water Sources</li>\n    </ol>\n</li>\n<p>Conserve water by using onsite alternative water sources to further reduce the demand for fresh water. </p>\n<p>An onsite alternative water source is water sourced, collected, treated, stored, and utilized as recycled water. Recycled water has varying degrees of quality. Take precautionary measures when using recycled water. Select only recycled water of a quality that is safe and appropriate for the intended use.</p>\n<p>Instead of using fresh water for some applications that require the use of water, first study the feasibility of utilizing recycled water from condensate drain water, rainwater, treated wastewater (grey water), blowdown water, or reject water. Maintained and operated properly, these onsite alternative water sources provide significant contributions to the reduction on fresh water demand.</p>\n<p>Water quality is of prime importance for reuse of onsite sources of water in terms of the source and the potential types of treatment that may be needed to meet the quality needs of the proposed end use. It is critical to ensure that the quality of the recycled water is appropriate according to local regulations.

The water is collected in the drain pan and discharged outside through the building drainage system.</p>\n        <p>The volume of condensate drain water from an air conditioning equipment varies. There are factors affecting the volume of condensate drain water produced from the operation of air conditioning equipment. The water quality from the condensate drain is usually good for cooling tower make-up water, as it is generally free from minerals and total dissolved solids (TDS).</p>\n        <p>Condensate drain water is generally safe for direct use in cooling towers with biocide control, or for sub-surface irrigation without the need for additional treatment. Condensate drain water however, when sourced from the recirculated air in the building, could develop bacterial growth and contaminate the recycled water. Thus, recycled water applications where humans can inhale or come in direct contact with contaminated vapors (e.g., spray irrigation), should be filtered and disinfected prior to discharging.</p></li>\n    <li>Rainwater<p>Facilities with large areas of impervious surfaces (horizontal and vertical) can capture rainfall for use in non- potable applications instead of discharging it directly to the storm drainage system. Rainwater run-offs from rooftops and building surfaces are typically of good quality for recycling, making it suitable for a wide variety of applications. In most facilities, it is used to supplement or replace irrigation water with minimal treatment or filtering requirements.</p>\n        <p>Rainwater that runs off on non-roof or podium surfaces, such as outdoor parking lots, hardscapes, and landscapes, around the building perimeters can also be a good source of irrigation water for landscapes; provided it can be collected, treated, and stored. Generally, this collected water can be captured and distributed from onsite features, such as berms, swales, or rain gardens, or can be diverted to a long-term storage retention pond, where the water can be pumped for landscape irrigation or other uses. The rainwater quality from the ground is much more variable than that collected from rooftops, as ground levels tend to pick up more varieties of pollutants as it travels across the landscape. Identify the required recycled water quality for the intended application and provide the appropriate treatment before rainwater is used.</p></li>\n    <li>Treated Grey Water<p>Grey water is all wastewater that is generated in buildings and is free of human waste. It should be separated from soiled water (black water) from toilets or urinals and excludes wastewater from kitchen sinks. Grey water can be treated and reused for specific onsite applications; however, health and safety standards and regulations must be fully complied with. To avoid bacterial and pathogens growth, ensure the use of treated grey water as advised by the concerned authorities. Treated grey water used for irrigation should not be used for vegetation intended for human consumption. The applications for an on-site treated grey water system may include indoor restricted urban water use, such as toilet and urinal flushing, and outdoor unrestricted urban water use, such as irrigation.</p>\n        <p>The selection of treated grey water as an on-site alternative water source requires a careful and site-specific analysis. Before installing an on-site grey water treatment facility, consult the authority having jurisdiction first to ensure that the treated grey water system meets the appropriate regulations. Further, check with the manufacturers of the fixtures and equipment the applications of non-potable water to determine which conditions those items can function with treated grey water and what impact such use will have on warranty coverage.</p></li>\n    <li>Cooling Equipment Blowdown<p>The cooling equipment blowdown is the cooling water that is periodically ejected from the cooling equipment to lessen the build-up of Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) that can cause scaling as water is evaporated from the heat exchangers. Cooling equipment that requires blowdown can include cooling towers, evaporative air condensers and evaporative coolers.</p>\n        <p>The blowdown cooling water when not used is typically discharged to the sanitary sewer. The water quality of blowdown could still be sufficient for use with other on-site applications such as irrigation water. However, the blowdown water has TDS content of 2 to 5 times that of the original source water. Algae, bacteria, or pathogens and water treatment chemicals, such as biocides or corrosion inhibitors are contaminants that may be present in the water and with high concentrations could harm humans that come into contact with the vapors. Therefore, blowdown water should not be used for applications that pose a direct threat to human health. However, blowdown water could be treated using nano filtration or RO membranes to make it suitable for other uses, including recycling as make-up water for cooling equipment. Facility managers should conduct a risk assessment before reusing this blowdown water.</p></li>\n    <li>Reverse Osmosis System Reject Water</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The onsite RO treatment facility uses membranes to filter the feedwater contaminants. The RO filtration process will have a residual stream, called the reject water, that remains after the feedwater has been permeated through the membrane. A RO system with a recovery rate between 50% and 75% produces 50% to 25% of rejected water from the system. This reject water is less pure than the feedwater entering the system but may still be useable for other applications.</p>\n<p>Reject water when unused is sent directly to the sanitary sewer. Some reject water is still suitable for other on-site applications. If sanitary conditions are maintained for storage and transfer, reject water can be appropriate for end uses requiring suitable water quality, such as: toilet and urinal flushing water; cooling tower make-up water; above-ground irrigation water; make-up water for water features; or other processes or uses not requiring potable water. Reject water with elevated levels of TDS may be used as irrigation water for plants with a high tolerance for salinity. If used for cooling tower make- up water, the reject water TDS concentration should not exceed the cooling tower TDS set point.</p>")

Monitor and record water meter readings between peak and off-peak hours to establish if leaks are occurring within the water distribution system.</p>\n            <p>- Install fail-safe control devices, or leak detection systems, on major water-using equipment or distribution lines.</p>\n            <p>- Conduct visual and detection and alarm system inspections of the facility on a periodic basis. </p>\n            <p>- Perform random and routine visits in the building, including visual inspections of the ceilings and floors, toilets, kitchens, plantrooms and other spaces where possible water accumulations could occur due to water leaks. </p>\n            <p>- Provide information campaign materials to building occupants, employees, and visitors to immediately report to facility maintenance staff any leaks that have been observed in private restrooms, kitchen areas, or any part of the facility.</p></li>\n        <li>Sanitary Fixtures and Equipment<p>- Verify and identify inefficient water fixtures. Replace water closets and flush valves with models that meet GSAS requirements for water efficiency. While current codes require the lower flow rate for new fixtures, existing buildings often use older, high-flow flush valves. </p>\n            <p>- Replace existing plumbing fixtures with water-efficient fixtures. In most cases, fixtures and valves will need to be replaced to ensure proper operation of the fixture and reduce the chance of clogging.</p>\n            <p>- Utilize dual-flush valves on water closets. For example, dual-flush valves provide a full 6.0-lpf flush and an optional 3.0-lpf half flush.</p>\n            <p>- Install water-efficient urinals, which use as little as half a liter of water per flush, or less than 10 percent of current low-flow models, especially in densely populated areas.</p>\n            <p>- Install or replace existing lavatory faucets and sink aerators with more restrictive and high efficiency aerators.</p>\n            <p>- Use treated grey water supply systems as an alternative water source for use in water closets and urinals. The use of grey water can considerably reduce consumption of domestic water.</p>\n            <p>- Maintain and operate laundry and dishwashing equipment to its optimum capacity. Check and repair any leaks and damaged components for efficient operation.</p>\n            <p>- Install appliances with technologies that can significantly reduce water and energy use. </p></li>\n        <li>Outdoor Water Use<p>- Periodically review all landscape service and maintenance contracts. Update the requirements for water-efficiency where applicable.</p>\n            <p>- Maintain a sufficient quantity of good topsoil to capture precipitation as it falls and to release water back to plants over time, reducing irrigation requirements. </p>\n            <p>- Add mulch to plant beds to cover bare soil. Re-mulch areas annually to maintain soil coverage and prevent erosion.</p>\n            <p>- Keep the irrigated landscape trimmed and free of weeds.</p>\n            <p>- Provide structured shaded areas in the overall landscape design to reduce the water needs of surrounding plants. </p>\n            <p>- Use water-efficient engineered systems for water feature recirculating systems. Maintain and operate water recirculation systems periodically for leaks and other damage. Where feasible, use recycled water in water features.</p>\n            <p>- Avoid using fresh water to dust-sweep the grounds or floors of outdoor areas, such as driveways and walkways, parking lots, playing courts, hard decks and courtyards, or other hardscapes. Use alternative means, such as brooms and pans to dust-clean these outdoor areas to conserve water.</p>\n            <p>- Ensure the irrigation schedule is appropriate for the climate conditions, soil conditions, plant species, grading, and season.</p>\n            <p>- Check that the sprinkler components are installed and calibrated such that the supplied water is irrigating the plants and not the pavements or roadways. </p>\n            <p>- Require a full audit of the irrigation system on a periodic basis. A full audit should include an in-depth assessment of the irrigation system, performance, and schedule. </p>\n            <p>- Ensure efficient grouping of plants with similar irrigation needs using a hydrozoning technique in consultation with field experts. </p>\n            <p>- Specify plants and irrigation systems that can significantly lower the volume of water needed to sustain the landscape. Refer to GSAS D&amp;B manual for plant types and irrigation methods that could meet the water budget based on the local climate. The Water Budget Tool can help evaluate the relative water savings that can be achieved with a different plant palette and technology choices.</p>\n            <p>- Use other alternative water sources, where feasible, as a substitute for potable water sources for irrigation. </p>\n            <p>- Utilize bushes, mulch, rain gardens, permeable hardscape, or curb cuts in parking lot islands or in the areas between sidewalks and the roadway for water run-offs.</p>\n            <p>- Check and maintain water features regularly to ensure they are continuously operating at optimum capacity. Use an engineered recirculating system, designed and tested to operate with an optimized water flow rate and energy use.</p>\n            <p>- Consult with landscape professionals, preferably trained and certified, but more importantly with working experience on practical applications of water-efficient and climate-appropriate landscaping works.</p></li>\n        <li>Onsite Alternative Water Sources</li>\n    </ol>\n</li>\n<p>Conserve water by using onsite alternative water sources to further reduce the demand for fresh water. </p>\n<p>An onsite alternative water source is water sourced, collected, treated, stored, and utilized as recycled water. Recycled water has varying degrees of quality. Take precautionary measures when using recycled water. Select only recycled water of a quality that is safe and appropriate for the intended use.</p>\n<p>Instead of using fresh water for some applications that require the use of water, first study the feasibility of utilizing recycled water from condensate drain water, rainwater, treated wastewater (grey water), blowdown water, or reject water. Maintained and operated properly, these onsite alternative water sources provide significant contributions to the reduction on fresh water demand.</p>\n<p>Water quality is of prime importance for reuse of onsite sources of water in terms of the source and the potential types of treatment that may be needed to meet the quality needs of the proposed end use.

The water is collected in the drain pan and discharged outside through the building drainage system.</p>\n        <p>The volume of condensate drain water from an air conditioning equipment varies. There are factors affecting the volume of condensate drain water produced from the operation of air conditioning equipment. The water quality from the condensate drain is usually good for cooling tower make-up water, as it is generally free from minerals and total dissolved solids (TDS).</p>\n        <p>Condensate drain water is generally safe for direct use in cooling towers with biocide control, or for sub-surface irrigation without the need for additional treatment. Condensate drain water however, when sourced from the recirculated air in the building, could develop bacterial growth and contaminate the recycled water. Thus, recycled water applications where humans can inhale or come in direct contact with contaminated vapors (e.g., spray irrigation), should be filtered and disinfected prior to discharging.</p></li>\n    <li>Rainwater<p>Facilities with large areas of impervious surfaces (horizontal and vertical) can capture rainfall for use in non- potable applications instead of discharging it directly to the storm drainage system. Rainwater run-offs from rooftops and building surfaces are typically of good quality for recycling, making it suitable for a wide variety of applications. In most facilities, it is used to supplement or replace irrigation water with minimal treatment or filtering requirements.</p>\n        <p>Rainwater that runs off on non-roof or podium surfaces, such as outdoor parking lots, hardscapes, and landscapes, around the building perimeters can also be a good source of irrigation water for landscapes; provided it can be collected, treated, and stored. Generally, this collected water can be captured and distributed from onsite features, such as berms, swales, or rain gardens, or can be diverted to a long-term storage retention pond, where the water can be pumped for landscape irrigation or other uses. The rainwater quality from the ground is much more variable than that collected from rooftops, as ground levels tend to pick up more varieties of pollutants as it travels across the landscape. Identify the required recycled water quality for the intended application and provide the appropriate treatment before rainwater is used.</p></li>\n    <li>Treated Grey Water<p>Grey water is all wastewater that is generated in buildings and is free of human waste. It should be separated from soiled water (black water) from toilets or urinals and excludes wastewater from kitchen sinks. Grey water can be treated and reused for specific onsite applications; however, health and safety standards and regulations must be fully complied with. To avoid bacterial and pathogens growth, ensure the use of treated grey water as advised by the concerned authorities. Treated grey water used for irrigation should not be used for vegetation intended for human consumption. The applications for an on-site treated grey water system may include indoor restricted urban water use, such as toilet and urinal flushing, and outdoor unrestricted urban water use, such as irrigation.</p>\n        <p>The selection of treated grey water as an on-site alternative water source requires a careful and site-specific analysis. Before installing an on-site grey water treatment facility, consult the authority having jurisdiction first to ensure that the treated grey water system meets the appropriate regulations. Further, check with the manufacturers of the fixtures and equipment the applications of non-potable water to determine which conditions those items can function with treated grey water and what impact such use will have on warranty coverage.</p></li>\n    <li>Cooling Equipment Blowdown<p>The cooling equipment blowdown is the cooling water that is periodically ejected from the cooling equipment to lessen the build-up of Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) that can cause scaling as water is evaporated from the heat exchangers. Cooling equipment that requires blowdown can include cooling towers, evaporative air condensers and evaporative coolers.</p>\n        <p>The blowdown cooling water when not used is typically discharged to the sanitary sewer. The water quality of blowdown could still be sufficient for use with other on-site applications such as irrigation water. However, the blowdown water has TDS content of 2 to 5 times that of the original source water. Algae, bacteria, or pathogens and water treatment chemicals, such as biocides or corrosion inhibitors are contaminants that may be present in the water and with high concentrations could harm humans that come into contact with the vapors. Therefore, blowdown water should not be used for applications that pose a direct threat to human health. However, blowdown water could be treated using nano filtration or RO membranes to make it suitable for other uses, including recycling as make-up water for cooling equipment. Facility managers should conduct a risk assessment before reusing this blowdown water.</p></li>\n    <li>Reverse Osmosis System Reject Water</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The onsite RO treatment facility uses membranes to filter the feedwater contaminants. The RO filtration process will have a residual stream, called the reject water, that remains after the feedwater has been permeated through the membrane. A RO system with a recovery rate between 50% and 75% produces 50% to 25% of rejected water from the system. This reject water is less pure than the feedwater entering the system but may still be useable for other applications.</p>\n<p>Reject water when unused is sent directly to the sanitary sewer. Some reject water is still suitable for other on-site applications. If sanitary conditions are maintained for storage and transfer, reject water can be appropriate for end uses requiring suitable water quality, such as: toilet and urinal flushing water; cooling tower make-up water; above-ground irrigation water; make-up water for water features; or other processes or uses not requiring potable water. Reject water with elevated levels of TDS may be used as irrigation water for plants with a high tolerance for salinity. If used for cooling tower make- up water, the reject water TDS concentration should not exceed the cooling tower TDS set point.</p>")

The non-organic waste generated by buildings is insufficiently reused worldwide. Similarly, organic waste, the main stream of waste generated, accounts for 50 to 60% of the municipal solid waste with very little being composted for reuse. This makes composting a practice that can significantly mitigate the problem.</p>\n<p>Industrial buildings generate hazardous waste that poses a great risk to human health and habitat contamination. Deviation of hazardous waste from landfill is essential to avoid such major health and environmental impacts. </p>")
