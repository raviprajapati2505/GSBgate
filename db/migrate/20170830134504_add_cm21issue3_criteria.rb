This includes energy use at site offices, canteens, workers&rsquo; accommodation (if attached to construction site) and any temporary office/accommodation facility at construction site.</p>\n<p>The contractor is encouraged to reduce building energy consumption under this criterion to achieve higher score. This is based on comparison of building energy consumption with the reference value.</p>\n<p>Contractors shall strive to achieve better energy ratings in the GSAS building energy assessment. The provision of buildings with higher GSAS energy ratings during the construction process is the most effective way to reduce energy consumption. One way to achieve this is by targeting higher energy performance scores (lower values of Energy Performance Coefficient, EPC). </p>\n<p>All EPC values are based on normative, standardized calculations or measurement of outcomes (energy use as built either calculated or measured), and divided by a reference value for a given building type. Analogously, in the GSAS scoring method, lower the energy consumption (or lower EPC value); higher the resulting GSAS score (0, 1, 2 &amp; 3). Building energy demand on subsystems, such as HVAC, lighting, and power, can be reduced by making good selections in building system types and their sizing. These guidelines provide recommendations for the contractor to meet the imposed limits on energy use with pointers on the standard calculations that have to be conducted to demonstrate compliance with the requirements.

The major sources of artificial light include street lighting, security lamps, vehicle head lamps, advertising and display lighting, floodlights and building illumination. Light pollution competes with starlight in the night sky for urban residents, interferes with astronomical observatories and, like any other form of pollution, disrupts ecosystems.</p>\n<p>Reducing light pollution implies many things, such as reducing sky glow, reducing glare, reducing light trespass, and reducing clutter.

Any mud, soil or dirt which has been spread onto the public roads is to be removed and cleaned promptly.</p>\n<p><span>b.\t</span>Ensure that the choice of materials for boundary fencing takes into account the surrounding land use. Use a solid fence providing security, safety, visual barrier, and partial acoustic attenuation for sites in or directly adjacent to residential areas. Whereas a chain link or similar fencing is sufficient for sites in more remote areas away from sensitive neighbors or which is adjacent to other construction sites.</p>\n<p><span>c.\t</span>Minimize solid waste piles on-site, covered with netting or tarpaulin and bounded by hoardings, to minimize their visual impact.</p>\n<p><span>d.\t</span>Minimize ground disturbance and vegetation removal that could result in visual impacts that produce contrasts of color, form, texture, and line.

The noise monitoring program will incorporate the use of a noise monitor such as a noise dosimeter or any other noise monitoring equipment to monitor noise levels throughout construction process, during each construction stage specifically when pick activity and high-noise level is expected. It will include the monitoring of the noise generated from equipment and plants used during construction as well as the noise effecting the neighboring areas, especially the sensitive receptors.

The removal of natural vegetation and topsoil makes the exposed area particularly susceptible to erosion, leading to the degradation of soil quality, structure and texture of the soil. It can cause instability of both above and below grade structural features, including earthen embankments, built structures, and roadways and even change the texture due to breakdown of aggregates and the removal of smaller particles or entire layer of soil or organic matter. Further, these textural changes can alter the water holding capacity of the soil, enhancing susceptibility of the site to extreme conditions such as drought. Moreover, offsite sedimentation can cause degradation of downstream water quality and damage marine habitat. Sediment that reaches streams or watercourses can accelerate bank erosion, obstruct stream and drainage channels.</p><p>A number of mitigation and management measures shall be implemented to ensure erosion control effectiveness. These control measures include the following:</p>\n<p>a.\tDevelop a Soil Erosion Control Plan to employ erosion control practices, such as preserving natural vegetation where possible, directing the runoff away from exposed soils, planting temporary groundcover, and permanent revegetation of areas at risk for erosion damage. The plan shall include information on the soils present on the site and area of disturbance and summarizes design requirements that include amount, frequency, intensity, and duration of precipitation. It shall identify the stormwater runoff and run-on at the site, including expected flow and any controls to minimize peak and total stormwater volume. It shall also describe the stormwater discharge areas to maximize infiltration and increase sediment removal.</p>\n<p>b.\tAvoid soil disturbance as far as possible to minimize soil erosion. Erosion rates are directly proportional to the type and density of groundcover on the site. </p>\n<p>c.\tProvide additional means of erosion prevention and sediment control to the areas where soil is disturbed, because these areas are more prone to erosion and invasive weed species.</p>\n<p>d.\tPreserve natural vegetation as it is the most efficient and inexpensive form of erosion control, greatly reducing the need for revegetation. </p>\n<p>e.\tCreate buffer zones and setbacks to reduce the amount of erosion and runoff from the site. Restrict activities in areas with erosive potential by creating undisturbed areas with natural vegetation or areas that are suitable for revegetation with native plant species. Consider use of buffer zones and setbacks to protect streams and waterways, environmentally sensitive habitats, neighboring properties, structures, roadways, and pathways. </p><p>f.\tPlant/replant non-vegetated areas prone to erosion with native species to prevent further damage. Vegetation/revegetation helps to prevent erosion by slowing down runoff drainage on hillsides and protecting soil from wind erosion. The roots of plants serve to stabilize soils, and revegetation enhances water infiltration in the soil, reduces runoff, and traps sediment.</p>\n<p>g.\tDevelop a plan for erosion maintenance during construction including inspection and repair schedules.</p><p>B) Sediment Control</p>\n<p>Sediment control is a practice to keep eroded soil on the construction site. It is the second line of defense in case the erosion control measures are not fully functioning. Sediment control prevents the soil from washing off and causing water pollution to a nearby stream, or sea. Often these practices intercept and slow or detain the flow of stormwater to allow sediment to settle and be trapped. </p>\n<p>A number of mitigation and management measures shall be implemented to ensure sediment control effectiveness. These control measures include the following:</p>\n<p>a.\tInstall linear sediment barriers (such as silt fence, sandbag barrier, and straw bale barrier), which are typically placed below the toe of exposed and erodible slopes, down-slope of exposed soil areas, around soil stockpiles, and at other appropriate locations along the site perimeter;</p>\n<p>b.\tInstall buffer zone or vegetated filter strip to catch sediment and decrease velocity of runoff;</p>\n<p>c.\tInstall earth dykes to contain sediment;</p><p>d.\tMake diversion ditches to keep up-slope runoff from crossing areas of high erosion risk and direct runoff to temporary sediment trapping basins; </p>\n<p>e.\tEnsure that drain surface of drainage lines are rock-lined to minimize erosion;</p>\n<p>f.\tInstall a sediment basin (temporary pond) to capture eroded or disturbed soil that is washed off during rain storms, and protect the water quality of a nearby river, sea or lake;</p>\n<p>g.\tInstall silt fence, which is a temporary sediment control device used on construction sites to protect water quality in nearby streams, rivers, lakes and seas from sediment (loose soil) in stormwater runoff. Silt fences are perimeter controls, typically used in combination with sediment basins and sediment traps, as well as erosion controls, which are designed to retain sediment in place where soil is being disturbed by construction processes (i.e., land grading, reclamation and other earthworks). Consider the following in silt fence installation;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Silt fence is to be installed along the perimeter of the area to be cleared and graded before any grading that takes place and placed around all soil and erodible materials stockpiles;</li>\n<li>Silt fence is to be properly installed by being trenched and buried into the soil to stop the fence floating free when a strong current of flow strikes it;</li>\n<li>Sediment is captured by silt fences primarily through ponding of water and settling, rather than filtration by the fabric. Sand and silt tends to clog the fabric, and then the sediments settle in the temporary pond.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>h.\tDevelop a plan for sediment control maintenance during construction including inspection and repair schedules.</p>")

Lands of habitat for wildlife species are converted into residential, commercial developments, infrastructure and other uses. The fast-paced development of land destructs and fragments the habitat at site, impacting its quantity and quality. Development eliminates and significantly changes many important habitat features, thereby altering the habitat value of the site. Furthermore, linear developments are generally responsible for fragmentation of habitats. When habitat of ecologically sensitive species is separated by distances, it makes their movement from one area to another impossible; which affects their health and the ability to reproduce that results in fewer species. Examples of sites with high ecological value are: areas containing rare and endangered wildlife species; sites with a high representation of indigenous biodiversity; key biological sites such as wetlands, seagrass beds, and mangroves; and areas that could be easily rehabilitated to provide a suitable habitat for wildlife.</p>\n<p>Ecologically sensitive habitats are not limited to the project site and usually extend into adjacent areas and beyond. The impact of development extends beyond the actual area of development. The encroachment of development into a natural area creates changes in environmental conditions as well as in animal behavior and well-being.

Some of these uses are: dust or landfill suppression, manufacturing of concrete and mortar, curing of concrete, testing of water-proofing, painting and cleaning.</p>\n<p>Wastage of Water</p>\n<p>There can be a number of causes of non-domestic water wastage during the construction, such as: negligence of users, unqualified workforce, inefficient operation of hydraulic installations, inappropriate design, leakages and flaws in construction facilities/equipment and lack of maintenance.</p>\n<p>Non-domestic Water Efficiency at Construction Sites</p>\n<p>The contractor shall consider water efficiency measures for non-domestic use with varying intensities over the period of the construction works.</p><p>A number of mitigation and management measures can be instigated to control water consumption for non-domestic use. These control measures include the following.</p>\n<p>A) General requirements </p>\n<ul>\n<li>As a general rule, contractors must ensure that non-mains water sources are utilized to the maximum (wherever it is practical). This includes source of water abstracted from water bodies, the treated waste water network or settlement lagoons on or near the site may provide sufficient quantity/quality of water for a number of water-intensive activities such as dust suppression or wheel washing. While utilizing water in this way it is imperative to make sure that all legal requirements are taken care of first (e.g. ensure that the suitable abstraction license are obtained from the relevant environmental regulator and that the surface water table has adequate levels).</li>\n<li>Ensure all water sources are accurately quantified, mains water being particularly important. This may include installation of sub-meters on any stand-pipes being used. </li>\n<li>Install leak detection systems to quickly and efficiently identify and locate water leakage points.</li>\n<li>Control and monitor water use in construction activities. Periodic readings should be taken from all meters and sub-meters (weekly is recommended in most instances). Regular out-of-hours meter readings might also help to detect any leaks or other unwarranted consumptions.</li>\n<li>Encourage off-site production of concrete since factory conditions allow for maximum measurement precision resulting in less consumption of materials and ensuring reuse of waste. Factory production will also result in less dust on the site reducing the need for site watering and vehicle washing. </li>\n</ul><p>B) Dust Suppression</p>\n<ul>\n<li>At the construction site, dust suppression is often associated with stockpiles and overlays, site roads and wheel washes. Dust suppression methods range from simple pouring or spraying of water through to the use of bowsers for larger areas (e.g. roads). </li>\n<li>Use the nozzle technology to create a more effective spray pattern for dust suppression. </li>\n<li>Use dust wetting additives, where possible which can contribute to the reduction of water consumption for dust suppression activities. For example, some additives reduce the surface tension of dust suppression water, which increases the time taken for the water to dry out, thus reducing the total volume of water required. </li>\n<li>Limit access to standpipes, hoses, boom sprayers, and other water consuming equipment by properly trained users. </li>\n<li>Ensure that the sustainable approaches have been considered to reduce the amount of water used for watering. </li>\n<li>Ensure that the water collected, filtered or recycled on site is used for watering if possible. Avoid the use of potable water for this purpose.</li>\n</ul><p>C) Washing and Cleaning </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid the use of drive-through wheel washing systems as they do not recycle water which results in water waste. The use of a closed loop wheel wash with a settlement tank and water recycling system can improve the water efficiency of wheel washing systems. </li>\n<li>Use waterless wheel cleaning systems option, if possible, that use angled steel grids to clean debris from the wheels.</li>\n<li>For washing out concrete wagons mains pressure hoses with basic spray patterns are water inefficient. One should consider implementing a high-pressure, low-volume efficient spray pattern to reduce water use; or a specially designed sock to cover the chute could be considered as an option to minimize water use, reduce spills and eliminate pollution. </li>\n</ul><p>D) Water Use During Commissioning </p>\n<p>High volumes of water are used during construction of the building envelope, water proofing works and testing, general cleaning of site and high pressure or specialist cleaning. Reduce water consumption through the following. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Maximize the opportunity of water recycling by advance planning of water use during the commissioning. </li>\n<li>Isolate the water used for building flushing activities as soon as the flush water turns clear to avoid the unnecessary use of water. </li>\n</ul>")
