Interior noise levels should be maintained as not to interfere with the regular tasks of occupants and users. Consider noise generated both outside the building, on the building&rsquo;s site or adjacent properties, as well as noise generated from services, equipment and activities within the proposed building. Determine the specific requirements for each space, including privacy levels, sound isolation needs and acceptable background noise levels. Implement strategies for the appropriate acoustic performance levels within each area of the building.</p>\n<p>Noise can be divided in three categories: direct airborne noise; impact noise and vibrations. Provide strategies to mitigate the effects of each one.</p>\n<p>Direct airborne noise can be produce by external or internal sources. Be aware of the location of noise-sensitive spaces within the building plan. Use vegetation, earth berms or other noise barriers on the site as a means of muffling off-site noise before it reaches the building. Specify the appropriate sound transmission class (STC) rating of interior partitions, windows and doors to protect spaces from harmful noise sources. STC is a number rating system used to compare the sound insulation properties of building elements including walls, floors, ceilings, windows and doors. STC ratings are impacted by the height of partition walls; in cases where sound isolation and/or privacy levels are important, specify full-height partition constructions. Consider using acoustical ceiling tiles and wall panels or spray-on acoustical treatments in spaces where additional sound absorption is necessary.</p><p>Floor Impact noise is usually caused by building use itself, as stepping.  Sound insulation performance varies with the type of structural system, floor and ceiling construction methods, slab types and thicknesses, flooring materials... The most common solution is to place floating floors. In addition, elastic elements can be placed between the floating floor and the forging to prevent the transmission of vibrations. Suspended ceilings can be another solution. Soft elastics surfaces or carpet on the emitting space floor may reduce the vibrations of the flooring caused by use.</p>\n<p>Minimize excessive vibration from services and equipment to mitigate acoustic problems in the building interior. Separate noise-generating areas from noise-sensitive spaces within the building. Provide sufficient noise insulation to mitigate impacts from interior noise sources such as those generated by plumbing systems, elevators, mechanical ventilation systems and air conditioning equipment. </p>\n<p>Be aware about joints between the floating floors or suspended ceiling fixtures and other surfaces create acoustic bridges. In the case of floating floors, special attention must be paid to the entrance to the enclosure, since again acoustic bridges are created.</p>\n<p>Consider the use of soft, sound absorbent materials for interior finishes including walls, floors and ceilings to reduce noise levels. A higher sound absorption rate will attenuate noise transferred from the exterior or generated within the building, and will increase the acoustic performance within the building.

Reduce the energy needed for electrical lighting by providing daylighting being mindful that introducing daylight into building interiors may also increase solar heat gain and cooling loads. Ensure through calculations and simulations that benefits obtained from daylighting will not be compromised by a significant increase in energy use. The quality and quantity of daylighting within the building is affected by window placement and sizes, glazing transmittance, room geometry, interior surface finishes, and shadows cast from nearby buildings. Daylight can be filtered into interior spaces through the use of plants, blinds, shades, light-scattering glazing types or architectural devices such as louvers and baffles.</p>\n<p>Provide light levels no less than those recommended in the IESNA Lighting Handbook, or equivalent. Determine the appropriate light levels for each of the different task-related spaces in the proposed building and design the lighting system to meet these requirements. For example, tasks that take place in a conference room are considered &lsquo;visual tasks of high contrast and large size,&rsquo; and would require a horizontal illuminance value of 30 foot-candles according to the IESNA standard. Avoid over-illumination of entire rooms or spaces by providing individual task or accent lighting where higher illumination levels are needed.</p><p>Lighting systems should allow for adjustments by the occupants as necessary to promote comfort and maximize visual performance. Lighting controllability is the amount of control an individual has to turn lights off and on, adjust brightness and change the positioning of fixtures. The extent and type of lighting controls should relate to the function of each space, the amount of occupants, the frequency of use and level of daylighting within each space. Develop light fixture layouts in conjunction with furniture and workstation layouts to maximize lighting efficiency. Consider the use of automatic lighting control systems for spaces where both daylight and artificial lighting are used to minimize energy use. Automatic lighting control systems include the use of timers, daylight controls and occupancy/vacancy controls. Sensors can be used within the lighting system to adjust illumination levels in response to variable daylighting conditions and user occupancy/vacancy. Provide dimmable and stepped daylighting controls for greater control over the building&rsquo;s electric lighting system.</p>\n<p>The following important factors should be considered when specifying fi xtures to improve light quality and visual comfort within the building: luminance ratio limits, veiling reflections, reflected glare, shadows, color and intensity. Minimize illumination intensity and lighting power through the specification and selection of energy-efficient fixtures that use efficacious sources. Use high frequency fittings to minimize discomfort due to the flicker caused by luminaires that have a low frequency, such as conventional fluorescent luminaries. Consider lighting design strategies including light shelves and indirect lighting systems that reflect light off the ceiling, providing uniform, ambient lighting conditions. The ceiling shape may be designed to more efficiently distribute light from windows or skylights, such as through the use of a sloped or curved ceiling. The color, texture and reflectance of surface materials in a room can also help improve lighting conditions and minimize lighting needs.</p>")

With minimal rainfall, a hot and dry climate, and the depletion of groundwater at rapid rates, water has become a precious and limited resource in MENA region. The building should aim to reduce the demand on fresh water consumption as well as recycle, treat, and reuse water where feasible. Promote the efficient use of water in the building to mitigate environmental impacts associated with water scarcity and depletion.</p>\n<p>Strategies for consideration include the following: using efficient technologies, equipment, and fixtures; collecting, treating, and reusing greywater, rainwater, and sewage; minimizing water pollution; and properly managing and maintaining water-use systems. Incorporate as many strategies into the building as possible to reduce fresh water demand.</p>\n<p>1. Specification of water efficient equipment and fixtures.</p>\n<p>a) Water efficient equipment and fixtures.</p>\n<p>Consider specifying water efficient equipment such as low flush toilets, vacuum toilet flush systems, dual flush toilets, flow-controllers and regulators, water-saving valves and fixtures on faucets and showerheads, low flush urinals, low-water dishwashers, and occupant sensors. Specify automatic shut-offs, electronic sensors, and low-flow or lever taps on faucets. Dry fixtures such as composting toilets and waterless urinals can also be selected to reduce water demand. Leak detection systems should be installed to quickly and efficiently identify and locate water leakage points.</p><p>If the building has dining facilities, restaurants should provide ice water only on request to reduce overall ice consumption. In addition, specify air-chilled ice machines instead of water-chilled models. Installing high-efficiency dishwashers with rinse water recycling systems may contribute to additional water savings. Flight or conveyor dishwashers are most efficient, followed by under counter dishwaters. Manual dishwashing should be avoided.</p>\n<p>If the building has laundry facilities, the building should adopt laundry policies to use water more efficiently. Maximize water heating efficiency by separating the hot water system for laundry from other building water systems, if possible. Operate washers only at full capacity, and use the minimum amount of required detergent. To reduce the overall use of hot water and the need for harmful chemicals such as chlorine bleach, install ozone washing systems, or install high-efficiency washing machines with rinse water recycling systems.</p>\n<p>At hosting, strategically reduce the total number of ice machines to reflect average demand of hotel occupants. For legacy use, install shut off valves and plan to evacuate water from pipes in unused areas during smaller events which will decrease water loss and increase efficiencies.</p><p>Limit pool and spa drainage by maintaining the chemical balance of pool water. Install chemical regulators to avoid human error when balancing chemicals. Pools may only require annual drainage, whereas spas require more frequent drainage, which can be further reduced through proper monitoring of chemical composition. If applicable, install flow regulators within pools, hot tubs, or steam rooms to reduce water consumption from those devices. Post signage surrounding pool deck and hot tub rooms requesting users to limit their pool and spa facilities to a designated time. Due to the intense energy required for desalination, consider using saltwater pools. Saltwater pools reduce the need to purchase, store, add, and handle chlorine by converting the salt to chlorine through a chlorinator device. Because salt can be corrosive over time to metals like stainless steel or unsealed stone and cement, pool areas should be properly maintained and constructed of corrosion resistant materials</p><p>Industrial equipment should be installed to reduce the potential for leaks and spillage. Additionally, equipment should recycle and reuse water when possible.</p>\n<p>b) Installation of Water Meters.</p>\n<p>Water consumption can be reduced if its use is regularly monitored and managed during building operations. Install water meters on the main water supply to each building in the analyzed building. Water meters should be easily accessible and convenient for facilities operators. Sub-metering of water uses is also recommended for high water-usage operations, such as boilers and cooling towers, to ensure proper management and minimize water consumption. Monitor irrigation systems to control over-watering and to detect the build-up of nutrients such as nitrogen, calcium, potassium, and sodium. Consider connecting the water meter to the building monitoring system using a pulsed output to ensure detection of inefficiencies in water use and consumption.</p><p>2. Efficient Irrigation.</p>\n<p>Reduce the need for irrigation through the specification of native or adapted plants that require nominal or no irrigation after initial establishment. Shade the site where possible to minimize water loss due evaporation. Where irrigation systems are necessary, they should be regularly maintained and managed to ensure effective operation. Minimize the use of potable water for irrigation using harvested/recycled rainwater and greywater where feasible. Group plants with similar water needs for the most efficient use of water, and develop and implement appropriate watering schedules. Consider efficient, low-water irrigation systems such as drip feed subsurface systems, and utilize weather-based irrigation strategies such as rain shut-offs, moisture sensors, and evapotranspiration/smart irrigation controllers. Irrigation techniques for greywater may include drip feed subsurface systems, traditional evapotranspiration systems, and shallow trench systems that allow for subsurface irrigation of plant roots. If feasible, merge the greywater reuse system with the irrigation system to reduce the need to treat greywater on-site as well as to</p><p>reduce the need for potable water for irrigation use. Specify a subsurface irrigation system when using greywater to avoid possible risks to human health. Avoid the activation of irrigation systems during the day, and utilize mulch and/or gravel to prevent water evaporation from the soil.</p>\n<p>Landscaped areas used for recreational activities and competition, such as golf courses and soccer fields, should adopt landscape management practices that conserve water, and course design should reflect water conservation policies such as limiting lawn areas and eliminating water hazards. Further, reduce the need for irrigation by installing water retention systems underneath the soil, and cover putting greens with tarps during evening hours to trap condensation.</p><p>3. Staff and Users Education &amp; Maintenance Plans.</p>\n<p>Dishwashing and kitchen water consumption can be limited by posting educational information, holding seminars, and instructing staff members to consciously reduce overall water consumption during building operation. Educate kitchen staff regarding correct methods for thawing frozen food and rinsing foods. Sub-meter kitchen water use and back charge costs to the kitchens to help raise awareness about wasteful practices among kitchen managers. </p>\n<p>Develop strategic maintenance policies and procedures to ensure that water conservation is a focus in all building operations including cleaning, maintenance, and food service. Custodial staff should reduce water usage and the number of times toilets are flushed during room cleaning. Instruct users about the importance of water in the region. Incorporate water saving strategies into the design that allows users to participate in conservation.</p>\n<p>Additionally, power washing the building exterior should be done on an as-needed basis separate from the regular maintenance plan. Power washing should not be used for general cleaning purposes, such as spraying down loading docks, when sweeping or spot cleaning will suffice.</p><p>4. Reuse of rainwater and greywater for non-potable applications.</p>\n<p>Where possible, incorporate building systems to collect, store, and redistribute rainwater and greywater on the building site to reduce the building&rsquo;s potable water consumption. The treatment of rainwater and greywater is dependent upon the quality of the water; they do not necessarily have to be treated prior to redistribution. Greywater includes water discharge from building operations such as condensate from cooling systems, laundry, bathroom sinks, water discharged from cooling towers and water fountains. Greywater generated from kitchen and catering facilities should be stored and treated separately from other sources as oils and fats are difficult to remove. Dual plumbing lines can be used to separate greywater from sewage water ad should be installed during initial construction.</p>\n<p>Collect water generated by the operation of air conditioners, dehumidifiers and refrigeration units. Condensation does not necessitate a stringent treatment process but can contain contaminants and bacteria, and should only be reused for non-potable applications in the building, on the competition landscaping area and on the landscaped area on the total site.</p>\n<p>Rainwater can be harvested and collected using devices such as cisterns or underwater tanks. Rainwater collected from roofs and other impervious surfaces on the site can be filtered using various methods, including screens and paper filters. Water collected from paved surfaces such as roads and parking lots may require oil separators and further treatment to eliminate oils, fuels and other harmful substances. Reuse on-site greywater and rainwater for non-potable applications including toilet/urinal flushing, irrigation, custodial/janitorial uses, fire protection, mechanical systems and car washing.</p><p>5. Use of on-site sewage treatment systems.</p>\n<p>Treating sewage on-site produces sludge and water that can be used for both potable and non-potable uses, depending on the type of treatment. Recycling water produced from sewage can minimize water demand and consumption from building operations and reduce the burden on public treatment facilities. Sludge may be taken to appropriate disposal facilities or biologically digested on-site to produce methane. Use separate plumbing lines for sewage to isolate water from other wastewater systems. Consider innovative methods such as low-pressure dosing systems with septic tanks, and use techniques such as solid separators, sand filters, aerobic tank treatment and aquaculture systems to treat sewage. Sand filters are well-established sewage treatment systems and are extremely cost-effective. Aquaculture systems are biological techniques that utilize plants and fish to ingest pollutants in wastewater, in turn, producing purified water, food and fertilizer. Such systems require more maintenance to ensure proper functioning but may be an advantageous method for treating sewage. The various treatment systems should be researched and analyzed for the proposed building, peak and off peak flow rates, its specific goals and requirements Installation of water use sub-metering facilities.</p><p>6. Limit Water Features.</p>\n<p>Limit water features in and around the building or development to conserve water, and use recycled water for recirculation. Design water features with trickling or cascading fountains as they lose less water to evaporation than those spraying water into the air. Avoid placing water features outdoors due to the loss of water from evaporation. Indoor and outdoor water features should be operated on separate systems to prevent additional water loss. Also, consider using salt water in water features to reduce the need for desalinated water, but ensure that water feature materials such as tile and stone can withstand the corrosive properties of salt.</p>")
